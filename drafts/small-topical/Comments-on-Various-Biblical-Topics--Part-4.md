### **1. False Teachers, Cults, and False Prophets**

#### **Cults** 

Cults are all about controlling and manipulating their members by doing their very best to keep their victims out of God’s Word so that they can’t discover the truth for themselves. If this does occur, these organizations will lose the loyalty and membership of their followers, who will go elsewhere to find out the truth about all the matters they have falsely believed otherwise. The points below should suffice to give the reader a good enough idea of how these groups operate. 

Guilt is a big weapon cults use to steer their members in the direction they want them to go. If an individual within the group begins to see through the lies they have been taught, the most zealous and staunch members (usually the leaders and their inner circle) will use fear as a fulcrum to steer those in the right back into the wrong by speaking lies that if they don’t “repent” they are headed for hell. Indeed, the whole “*you’re going to hell unless you do this*” is a standard scare method because it is effective. Thankfully, many individuals have (and continue to) successfully withdrawn from cultic groups and false religions that teach salvation by works and not by grace through faith alone. 

Cults don’t want their members to have anything to do with the Bible. Those who diligently search the Scriptures are most likely to see through all the nonsense and break free from the whole satanic system. Cults love to control and manipulate their members. Once someone starts to pursue the truth themselves, threats come almost immediately. Life is not about living for God because it is not about spiritually advancing. Using free will to submit to Christ and follow His leading is a big “no, no” in these pathetic little groups because their goal is to limit free will to such an extreme that people no longer have the right to choose. Often, the “ring leaders” in charge dictate what other people decide to do. This behavior is very similar to how illegal drug organizations work with a “drug lord” who decides everything and demands the cooperation and silence of his customers. And if they give the whole operation away, terrible consequences are inevitable. 

Many cults and their groups violate the biblical principle of how and why God made us. God created man in His “image” and “likeness,” terms that refer to the human ability to exercise authority and respond to it through free will choice. God made us to respond to Him, not to petty human beings as if we were accountable to "creatures" and not the Creator (**Roman 1:25**). Can men play God? Absolutely not! That whole concept is no better than people trying to do what Satan did from the beginning by attempting to usurp God’s authority by placing themselves on equal ground with the Almighty- the epitome of pride and arrogance (**Isaiah 14:12-15**). The cult mentality is no better than those who wish to confess their sins to a priest. We answer to God, not people, who is our Master, not sinful men. 

Since Scripture already commands teachers not to Lord their authority over others, why would any person who claims to be a Christian attempt to gain mastery over their followers to such an extreme and sinful degree? 1 Peter 5:1-3 states, “*To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed:* ***2** Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; **3 not lording it over those entrusted to you**, but being examples to the flock.*” Anybody who picks up a Bible and reads it with an honest, open, and discerning heart will quickly come to realize that the cultic beliefs, practices, and behaviors (assuming they are wrong) are nothing but a satanic sham. 

Additionally, Matthew 20:25-28 states, “**25** *Jesus called them together and said,* *“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.* ***26** Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, **27** and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— **28** just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many*.” Cults only think of themselves because life is all about “self” and not God and the welfare of others. Instead, they are selfish, greedy people who don’t love and care for their fellow men but their own desires and way of life. They disobey the greatest commandment which Matthew 22:37 states as, “*Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind*.” That is the first and greatest commandment. The second is to love one’s neighbor as one’s self. Cults don’t obey these teachings despite the false impressions they give. Instead, they teach their listeners to trust in them and their manufactured rules over putting one’s faith in Christ. Proverbs 3:5-6 says, “*Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to Him and he will make your paths straight*.” Those who violate these commands above don’t obey the Bible because the Christian life is all about Jesus Christ! 

Cults are notorious as busybodies and nosy people who desire to know the what, when, where, and how of practically every aspect of their follower’s lives. The degree of how bad this may be does depend on the specific group, but that is still how it works, generally speaking. So what is the reason for this type of behavior? Something so demonstrably false must be saved through undergoing extreme precautions lest the group loses members that once adhered to its rules. The leaders and their most zealous comrades will do whatever is necessary to keep their followers from touching a Bible and reading it for themselves lest they discover the truth. For this very reason, cults wish to keep their adherents isolated from society, especially from other believers, because these individuals could share the truth with them by telling them what they need to hear from Scripture and common sense. In other words, all threats, whether actual or potential, have to be eliminated, something these groups will take pains to ensure. 

 The Bible doesn’t have good things to say about busybodies because we all need to keep our noses on our plate first so that we do not misjudge and condemn others inappropriately (**1 Timothy 5:13; 1 Thessalonians 4:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:11**). However, no Christian should ever be nosy in the negative sense at any point in their life! 

Some of you reading this may think, “*Yeah, but the people in my organization are very kind and promise to offer this or do this or that. They couldn’t possibly be cults*!” That is only what they want others to believe because how else are they supposed to gain a following? Anybody on the outside who sees what they are really all about wouldn’t even go near them in the slightest. But cults love to create impressions and appearances to the contrary by using deceptive rhetoric and dishonest words, promises, and actions to lead people astray. But the truth doesn’t need rhetoric or any fancy speech, nor does it ever change based on “the newest and latest argument.” Whatever they may promise now will turn out to be nothing but hollow and empty. Only the Lord Jesus knows the plans He has for us (**Jeremiah 29:11**), and it is to Him that we must put our hope and trust. Whoever hopes and trusts in Him will not be disappointed (**Romans 10:11; Psalm 25:3**). 

As if all the above wasn’t bad enough, cultic groups claim to be the only one’s who are saved and know the way of the gospel. In other words, they are right while everybody else is wrong and headed for the lake of fire. Secret teachings and doctrines are not uncommon in groups like these because their whole system rests on their false beliefs. They may demonstrate a slight appeal to Scripture to potential converts while talking a good talk and putting on a good face. The reality is that they have little substance. They have no leg to stand on, which is why they will try to make themselves and their beliefs the issue, not the Bible. This method is clever and subtle but quickly exposed when viewed from the lens of Scripture. You could think of somebody jumping in front of you with a counterfeit sign trying to get you to do something you shouldn’t while the actual sign sits over in the corner ignored and disrespected. The goal is to distract and keep the individual busy by keeping their attention on anything but God’s Word so that they never have the time or interest to look that way at all. And if this doesn’t work, threats and discipline are forthcoming.  Anybody caught up in one of these organizations who desires to get out need only read their Bible and seek a good solid teaching ministry where the truth of God’s Word is the top priority. 

Recovering from cultic influence, let alone getting out of one, is no easy task. But it is still doable with the help of the Spirit-inspired Word of God, which will guide and direct the thoughts, words, and actions of all those who heed it properly. Anybody who ignores the Word does so at their peril. Cults only make disciples for themselves, not for Jesus Christ. And those who genuinely wish to get out of a false group can and will do so, no questions asked. There is always hope for those who put their trust in the One who made them and died for them because of the love He has always had for all men long before time ever came into existence.

#### **False Teachers and Prophets** 

There exist no more significant threat outside or within the church than false teaching. Sadly, Satan has clever ways to extend his tentacles both inside and outside Christ’s body. False religion and teaching keeps people from coming to God and endangers Christ’s followers (those who have come to God) from falling away. 

But before we continue, what about the Gnostics so infamously known by the apostles? Well,  even though Gnosticism is far less common (if it all existent) today than it was in Paul’s time, the passages that address those individuals teach general principles that cover all false teachers in general. In other words, you will know them by their fruits (**Matthew 7:15-20**). 

**1 John 2:22** confirms that the liar and antichrist reject the Father and the Son. But there is perhaps no better passage than 1 John 4:1-5, which sums up how we can know who is a false teacher and who isn’t through the condensed statements, “  **2** *This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, **3** but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world*.” 

These two verses sum up how we can tell the two categories apart. But there is more to this than what appears on the surface. For one thing, different false teachers believe and teach different lies. 

For example, just because such and such person teaches there is no Trinity doesn’t mean they adhere to a works-based system of salvation. Yet, on the other hand, we there are plenty of people who accept all three members of the Godhead but trust in good works to save them. Ultimately, both groups reject Jesus Christ. 

So the above should suffice to tell us what constitutes a false teacher who, according to Scripture, will not inherit God’s kingdom. The above gives us only a few examples. But this doesn’t mean that anyone who teaches false doctrine (not related to how one gets saved) falls under the category of a wolve in sheep’s clothes headed for destruction. We live in Laodicea, the lukewarm era of the church (**Revelation 3:14-22**), so false teaching is everywhere. Nonetheless, many pastors and teachers worldwide teach false doctrines this writer disagrees with, such as once saved always saved (the extreme version), perseverance of the saints (the Calvinist’s version), Calvinism, pre-tribulation rapture, no genesis gap, tongues and healings and the list goes on. As severe as these lies may be, they do not constitute false teaching to such a serious degree that they condemn those who teach and believe them (as long as they have put their faith and trust in Jesus Christ). Instead, they put those who teach and listen to them at spiritual risk of falling away because of the harm such teachings do to faith. However, what matters is that a person believes and teaches that salvation is by grace through faith alone. If they have done this, believe it, and teach it, then they are saved regardless of whether they believe in some of the false doctrines just mentioned above (OSAS, pre-trib, etc.).  

The false teachers of such caliber and danger that Scripture describes teach false gospels and sinful behavior that lead people to trust in anything but God. We have mentioned some of them above as those who reject the Trinity and trust in good works. However, that list is far from complete of the many other unbiblical teachings that keep people from coming to God. 

To sum up, a false teacher (in the true sense) is anyone who teaches that there is another god or way unto Jesus Christ, a truth that may express itself in different forms of teaching. But that is what they all have in common, as 1 John clarifies. 

The above is how we can “test the spirits” to see whether they are from God. We can fulfill this mandate by examining from Scripture whether those teaching are getting the gospel correct or not. It all depends on how people tell others how to get saved. And although our 1 John passage mentions false prophets instead of false teachers specifically, the same applies to discerning false teachers. Anyone who claims to be Jesus Christ come back in the flesh rejects Him and teaches others to do so as well for that very reason (**Matthew 24:4-5**). However, those individuals would fall into the category of “false Christs.” But you could say they are also false teachers and prophets all wrapped in one because they do what all three types of people do. 

{{% scripture p="1 John 4:1 (NIV)" %}} 

Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

The gospel is the one thing no one can afford to get wrong because it is the way to eternal life, a path made possible by the Person (God’s Son Jesus Christ) and work (our Lord’s death, burial, and resurrection) of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, anyone who clouds and distorts the entrance into this eternity with God hinders not only themselves but others. 

{{% scripture p="Matthew 23:13 (NIV)" %}} 

**13** “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.

And, like cults, it matters little how kind, charismatic, flattering, clean-cut, and famous the person in question may be. Cults are only kind as long as you do things their way. But as soon as a person pursues the truth, they turn against them most viciously. Truth doesn’t require flattery or “professional speech” and good writing skills. By themselves, those things mean very little. The outside doesn’t necessarily speak for the inside, as was the case with the Pharisees who looked good outwardly but inwardly were filled with dead men’s bones (**Matthew 23:25-27**).  False teachers and leaders do not truly love their listeners because they don’t want them to have the truth to grow spiritually and spend eternity with God.  Anyone, whether a false teacher or prophet, who spreads lies and encourages others to believe and follow them is not speaking from God but themselves.

**17** I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned.

By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people. **19** Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.

Walk as children of light **9** (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), **10** and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. **11** Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. **12** For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. **13** But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, **14** for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”

Some teachers may be more difficult to discern than others. But if you examine what they say under the Spirit’s power, they will give themselves away eventually when they fail to pass the “sniff test.” 

{{% scripture p="Acts 17:11 (NIV)" %}} 

**11** Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.                                                    

{{% /scripture %}} 

Scripture is replete with many passages that warn against false teachers and prophets, including **Matthew 7:15, 2 Peter 2, 2 Timothy 4:3-4, Matthew 7:15-20, Colossians 2:8, Jude, 1 Timothy 6:3-5, Ephesians 4:14, Galatians 1:6-9**. 

Finally, every prophecy in Scripture except the tribulation has already occurred and is part of human history as we know it. The gift of prophecy is no longer given by the Spirit but was discontinued probably before or shortly after the completion of the New Testament canon. Therefore, anybody today who claims to have this gift of insight to predict the future is a liar who deceives himself and others. We already know from the Bible what will occur during the tribulation, though perhaps not as much as we may wish to know. What matters is that our Lord’s Word tells us everything we need to know so that we won’t be ill-prepared for those dark days to come if we take those words to heart. And how many times have we heard people predicting when Christ’s return will happen only to see them fail every time? Far too many people have gotten this issue wrong because they believed they could predict the future, something no believer today can do. All prophecy must agree with what the Bible says and must come true. If it doesn’t, it is false. And anybody who goes around repeating what we already know from Scripture, well, that is no prophecy but simply restating what is already known. That isn’t a bad thing just as long as the person doing it doesn’t claim to have done so through the gift of prophecy. 



### **2. Respecting Elders- The Proper Relationships Between the Young and the Old** 

respecting-elders-the-proper-relationships-between-the-young-and-the-old

Younger believers need to submit to and respect their elders. But what does this mean, and what does this not mean?

First, older people generally have more knowledge and experience than their younger counterparts (although experience in some areas is subjective). The principle is based on authority and the way God has ordained things. Younger people should not talk to older people as they would those closest to their age because this can lead to improper behavior.  

As a quick side discussion, in **Ephesians 6:1-4**, Paul states that children must obey their parents and that parents rear their children properly. Fathers must not exasperate their children by provoking them to wrath. That may only cause the adolescent to show less regard for them, defeating the whole purpose and encouraging disobedience. Children can indeed be in the right while parents in the wrong. However, this still doesn’t mean they should not respect and obey their parents as they should. 

What if a parent wants their child to do something unbiblical? The best thing for the young man or woman to do (assuming they are at the age of accountability) is put the Lord first and do the right thing. Not only is this not disrespectful to parents, but it also honors God, who comes before any man and acts as a witness and testimony to the older generation. But if a parent raises their child accordingly (**Proverbs 22:6**), then children will rarely have to do this because they will have parents who set a good example as role models, a standard the children need to follow and obey. Of course, adults will get things wrong, but this does not excuse children to usurp and abuse the proper relationship they need to have with their mother and father. The danger is that they may start looking for imperfections and then use them against their parents to disrespect the proper authority relationship. Therefore, children must obey their parents unless told to do something unbiblical. 

Anyway, greater age doesn’t technically guarantee more knowledge or wisdom, even if that is generally the case. Of course, this principle doesn’t eliminate the command to properly approach those older than ourselves (whoever “they” or “we” may be). But that has little to do with wisdom and knowledge. There are a good handful of godly young men and women alive in this world who have attained greater spiritual maturity than most of their elders around them, even if that isn’t the norm.  The reasons all come back to free will and the disposition of the individual’s heart. The Christian life is all about choice, meaning that God awards knowledge and wisdom to those who seek it the most. Some older people may not have (and still don’t) done a very good job at this throughout their life due to poor decisions on their part. Age doesn’t promise greater spiritual maturity and progress because that can depend on so many factors. So although time and age can play a significant role in a believers spiritual level, it is not always the deciding factor that determines their current relationship with the Lord. For example, Paul didn’t come into the faith until later than the rest of the eleven. Yet, he will most likely be the most rewarded apostle ever. 

Nevertheless, younger people need to respect their elders as they should in a way that demonstrates their submission and obedience to God. However, this does not excuse older people to lord themselves over others by disrespecting the younger crowd. Those less advanced in years need to be treated with love and respect just as any older person should be treated. Being older doesn’t excuse anyone from talking down to anybody else or heaping verbal abuse into their heads. Older individuals should never take advantage of the dignity and respect their age allows them but should set a good example by doing what is right, as Titus 2:2-8 demonstrates. Older men should not exasperate the younger generation but should carry themselves as men worthy of respect. And it is a person’s actions and behavior that will either make them easier or harder to look up to. Those who wish to be treated the way someone their age should be treated should not shoot themselves in the foot through poor behavior. That only defeats the whole purpose. It is harder to respect those who don’t respect others. 

{{% scripture p="Titus 2:2-8 (NIV)" %}} 

**2** Teach the older men to be **temperate**, **worthy of respect**, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in **love** and in endurance. **3** Likewise, teach the older women to be **reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers** or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. **4** Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, **5** to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, **to be kind**, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God. **6** Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. **7** In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness **8** and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.                            

{{% /scripture %}} 

In 1 Peter 5:5 below, the issue is not one of years and numbers, but authority based on the spiritual gift of teaching and leading God has given some individuals. So this passage applies to believers of all ages, both young and old. Laypeople need to submit to those in higher positions of authority (teachers), whether younger or older than they are. However, it is more likely that younger individuals are more prone to disrespecting authority, something the older members of the congregation have learned not to do from years of experience. It is for this reason why Peter addresses the younger members specifically. But the principle relationship between teacher and non-teacher still applies to people of every age (**Hebrews 13:17**). Without a proper leadership structure and those willing to follow it, very little unity and progress in the truth could exist. 

{{% scripture p="1 Peter 5:5 (NIV)" %}} 

**5** In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.                                                        

{{% /scripture %}} 

The passage above reminds us of another principle we haven’t discussed; the despise for younger teaching authorities. Paul preaches against this very same prejudice in 1 Timothy 4:12-13 when he writes, “ *Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.* ***13** Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching*.” Timothy was a young and very timid man. It is true that more years often means a more profound knowledge of God’s Word, but not always. The point is that only those gifted to teach may do so, not those who think they can or should, even though they don’t have the gift. And if the Lord calls a man to teach the Word from a certain point forward, then his age matters little because great Bible teachers can be both young and old. 

There is no guarantee Timothy knew more than many teachers older than him (he probably didn’t). The twelve, including Paul, had more knowledge and experience. But the point is that young men can and must teach if called upon to do so regardless of their age and what other people think about it. And of course, they must be adequately prepared to do so. 

Finally, the reader may ask, what does 1 Timothy 5:1a, which says, “*Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father”* mean? Firstly, it doesn’t mean a younger man cannot rebuke an older believer. And the Greek word for “elder” in 1 Timothy 5:1 is *presbuteros*, the same word used for elders in other verses (pastor teachers), not men more advanced in years.  

1 Timothy 5:1 aside, the real issue is **how** a younger believer rebukes an older brother, not whether a young Christian can rebuke one older than himself. There will be (hopefully few) times when some people (regardless of their age) step out of line and need correction. It is one thing to come down a little harder on another young believer closer to one’s age. It is another matter to do it the same way with someone who probably requires it less due to their age, status, and experience. Younger people are more likely to act up more often and in more dramatic ways than their elders because they have yet to experience many of the hard lessons those more advanced in years endured throughout their lifetimes. 



### **3. Teacher Standards, Church Discipline and Accountability Partners** 

teacher-standards-church-discipline-and-accountability-partners

In another part of our comment series, we have, to some extent, discussed the standards that Bible teachers need to live their lives around. However, the point of this section is to talk about the issue a little more in-depth. 

Many people should not automatically assume they have the gift of teaching without discerning the Lord’s calling for them specifically. Many young Christian men and women in the church want to get into something they aren’t called to do. Their enthusiasm leads them to believe they should do something they don’t have the gifting to carry out, which is why James 3:1 says that not many should become teachers or presume to be because the task is arduous and the standards high. Teaching takes a lot of hard work and commitment. Of course, there is a “division of labor” among them all because there is no one size fits all approach and method to teaching. So the degree of work and preparation will vary among individuals. 

Undoubtedly, many believers aspire to teach because they view it as more glorious than other spiritual gifts, but that is not the case. Instead, all gifts carry the same amount of importance, just with differing levels of standards and difficulty. Teachers are role models to those they teach that others look up to, so it is no surprise that many younger people want to pursue that type of service. However, James 3:1 makes it clear that it is not about desire but whether one has the gift from God. The Lord is the One who grants us our spiritual gifts and determines the results of our ministries. But so many within the church misunderstand this issue. Teaching is no joke, and it is far from easy. James isn’t saying those who have the gift shouldn’t submit to the Lord and teach, but rather, everyone should not assume things by running to false conclusions out of wishful thinking. Many don’t have the gift and yet believe they do, explaining why they end up getting into something they shouldn’t have. 

Although God holds teachers to higher standards, no believer, not even the greatest to ever live, came close to perfection. Psalm 130:3-4 states, “*If you Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you*.” So it would be unwise for anyone to state something like, “*Teachers need to be darn near perfect*” because that is not something anyone can come close to attaining. The phrase is a good one but lacks clarity because, on the one hand, it rightly encourages teachers to hold themselves to higher standards than other believers through greater discipline and self-control (they need to be after all). But, on the other hand, wording it this way makes it sound like a believer can come close to perfection, a complete impossibility if we were honest with ourselves. 

The problem is that some may attempt to define what “close to perfection” means so that they begin to put false standards and burdens on themselves that they can’t bear or ever attain. This behavior may encourage some to develop an “all or nothing approach.” They may think that if they don’t reach such and such a level, they are failing and doing a poor job. Next thing you know, they begin to despair and give in to fear, doubt, condemnation, and compromise even when their lifestyle has been acceptable. That mentality is a recipe for disaster because it will swamp a person’s faith. 

Overall, telling teachers they need to be **close** to perfect isn’t the best way to word things because this will never happen (nor has) with anybody. The passage we just referenced in Psalms certainly doesn’t seem to suggest close to “perfectionism.” Yes, our Lord commanded all believers to be holy because He is holy (**1 Peter 5:16**). But God knows that we are flesh and all fall short of His glory (**Romans 3:23**). The phrase above in no way suggests that believers don’t sin but gives a vibe that humans can come almost as close to perfect as Jesus was (because He was perfect), an untenable impossibility. Plus, as just stated, this may cause many believers to fall into despair because they rightfully know this will never happen. The fact that everyone sins every day confirms this fact. The statement does create a good incentive for them to put in all their effort through God’s strength, but could be better worded as “*Teachers need to be especially self-controlled and disciplined because they are role models to those they teach*.” The Lord asks and expects them to do more, which is why He holds them to higher standards resulting in a stricter degree of judgment. “*To whom more has been given, much is expected*.”

 Yes, continuous spiritual growth, progress, and production will lead to a higher level of holiness throughout an individual's lifetime. Therefore, we must all strive for perfection by giving our very best. But this writer believes it is false and unrealistic to believe this will result in someone getting close to Jesus's perfection. For this very reason, we have grace (**2 Corinthians 12:9**) because we humans are but flesh. 

The above does not excuse sin in any way, of course. But it does challenge us to give our very best efforts. A good comparison we can use is Moses and our Lord. We reference Moses because he spent forty days on Mount Sinai in prayer and contemplation. In contrast, our Lord spent forty days in the wilderness where He was tested and tempted, unlike any other person in all of history. If we were to compare the two honestly, do we think Moses would have come close to our Lord’s handling of His circumstances in the wilderness? He would have done better than most or all, but still a far cry from Jesus. Our Savior was perfect, while Moses was not. 

However, Moses was the most righteous of his generation and one of the greatest believers of all time who will most likely sit next to the Lord’s throne in eternity. But even he was nowhere close to perfect unless we want to assume he never sinned every day, week, month, and so forth. There have been great believers in Scripture that have failed far less than others, no doubt about that. But the Bible does not record every single sin committed by the greatest heroes of the faith for obvious reasons. We see some of their biggest failures, such as when Moses struck the rock in anger and unbelief and when David murdered and committed adultery. And then there was King Solomon who fell into idolatry for a time. 

In part three of our comments, we referenced 1 Timothy 3:1-7 as qualifications for teachers. Here, we will examine this passage more closely. 

{{% scripture p="1 Timothy 3:1-7 (NIV)" %}} 

Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. **2** Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, **3** not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. **4** He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. **5** (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) **6** He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. **7** He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.                                                                          

{{% /scripture %}} 

“*Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task*”

This writer believes that elders, bishops, and pastors are the same thing. Only deacons are a distinct office. Therefore, an overseer in the passage above would refer to a teacher. Also, pastors and teachers are the same because teachers “pasture” the flock of Christ through instructing them in God’s Word. They are not separate gifts. The principle applies to teaching and preaching because those are also the same. A teacher primarily teaches but can do a little bit of preaching (exhortation) by encouraging his listeners to apply the truth he has just taught them from Scripture. A pastor is both a teacher (primarily) and a preacher. A person who preaches but can’t teach is no pastor because he lacks the proper knowledge of the Word. A good pastor focuses primarily on explaining the meaning of the text while being flexible enough to enhance it’s importance through further explanation. 

Our verse above does not suggest that those in leadership positions have more noble ministries than others. At the very least, this doesn’t mean one is better than the other, but one carries a greater responsibility that will undergo greater scrutiny at the bema seat. 

*Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach* 

We have already stressed that teachers need to live more disciplined lives because of their “role model” status, meaning their level of spiritual maturity needs to be exceptionally high due to the nature of their work. And, of course, we have already mentioned that teachers need to be adequately prepared and gifted to carry out their ministry.

 Anger, unkindness, and disrespect do not present a good testimony but demonstrate a person who refuses to practice what he preaches. The simple reason for this is a disobedient attitude that selfishly chooses to do things one’s own way instead of God’s through the power of His spirit (**Galatians 5:13-26**). No believer can produce spiritual fruit when they aren’t walking in God’s power. 

{{% scripture p="Galatians 5:16-26 (NIV)" %}} 

**16** So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. **17** For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. **18** But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. **19** The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; **20** idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions **21** and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. **22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, **23** gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. **24** Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. **25** Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. **26** Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.                                      

{{% /scripture %}} 

No one is perfect, and what matters is that the individual in question continues to make efforts to improve and continues to see results. But if there is no desire to overcome one’s habitual struggles, then that is a clear sign that a man is not ready to teach because he cannot set a good example through the life he lives. He must not live a double life speaking one thing while consistently doing the opposite without any concern. 

 1 Timothy 5:19-22 states, “**19** *Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses*. **20** *But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning*. **21** *I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism*.” 

This passage above in no way suggests that laypeople cannot correct or rebuke their teachers when they are in error, but it is how they do it that matters (2-3 witnesses are needed). And if the pastor refuses to repent after his conduct has been exposed before all (so others may learn and take warning from his poor example), then he must be expelled. That is not to say he won’t repent later on (he is to be brought back in if he does). 

On the other hand, if a pastor is struggling badly with sin (a temporary deviation), that sin will naturally affect his production and how well he can teach others. It is the Lord's decision (not the congregation's) whether he should take a break from his main teaching to deal with his own issues. However, this does not imply that a teacher (or any struggling believer in general) stops ministering altogether. Ministry is always something we should continue to do regardless of how badly we may be struggling with something. But should a pastor teacher take a break from his congregation and have someone temporarily replace him? That is the Lord's decision, not the individuals' or the church's. The point is that we need to let God decide how we proceed in our ministries when sin has become more of a problem than it should be.                                                                  

To continue, church discipline (whoever may be involved) should not turn into a “busybody” activity where members begin unnecessarily sticking their noses into other people’s business. No believer (whether pastor or layperson) is required to confess their sins to other people but only to God. Expelling people for unrepentant behavior is what the Bible commands for us to do in cases when that is necessary (assuming everyone finds out about what the person(s) is doing). But there is nothing in Scripture that indicates that we should "discipline" struggling believers. Prayer is exhorted (**1 John 5:16-17**) but anything that goes past that is legalism. There is a difference between struggling with sin (such as a pastor who has temporarily lapsed into sin) and committing it high handedly without worry or care. 

Additionally, “accountability partners” are not a good and proper way to go about this. This approach isn’t supported anywhere in Scripture and is a bad idea because we don’t confess our sins to men but God because we are accountable to Him alone. Requiring accountability partners as some sort of “discipleship” approach is legalism. It is not right for others to see what another person views on the internet or where they go and what they do etc. (that is cultism). Nor is it the case that anyone should ever have to report to another for every single sin they know they committed in a single day. None of this is what **James 5:16** is saying. This passage is simply telling us that all members of the body should (to some degree) open up about their struggles (tell their pastor teacher) in order to receive prayer. **However, this should only be the case if the person is involved in serious habitual sin**. This is why the two verses right before verse sixteen say, "**14** *Is anyone among you sick* (a possible result of divine discipline)? *Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord*. **15** And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. **If they have sinned** (they have done something very, very wrong or have been sinning as a constant pattern but repent), **they will be forgiven**.." So James is telling us that some situations will require believers to open up about their sins to some extent. How can we pray for those who have lapsed into sin unless (in some cases) they don't tell us? We are supposed to pray for struggling believers, and there are some cases we cannot know (since not all sinful behavior is going to be open and flagrant) until the person in question actually speaks up and shares their issues. 

No believer is required to share the **everyday** sins they commit (this is something no one should be doing) or what bad things they tend to be more predisposed toward. Now, can believers share (not the same thing as confess) their **general** struggles with each other (someone they trust but who isn't a pastor teacher) for the sake of receiving encouragement and exhortation (it is just something the person really wants to do)? Yes (it may be a good idea for some and certain individuals may be led to it), but that is an area of application that needs to be done with caution and care so that those listening (whoever and how many they may be) will not stumble. It is best to focus on the solution and not the problem. Best not to get too far into details either as this can cause those listening to stumble in that same area as well if too much time and focus are given to the sin(s) itself.  James 5:16 deals with a very specific and less common extreme case of sin resulting in a more severe case of divine discipline. In a particular case like that, notifying the pastor and leaders of the church is something that needs to be done (sharing with only other laypeople in a serious situation like that is inadvisable). 

Discipleship is another word that gets thrown around to mean the same thing, but that is unbiblical. If we want to “disciple” other believers, we need to teach, encourage and exhort them through the truth of God’s Word rightly understood. Additionally, another great way to do this is to point them to a good solid teaching ministry where they can receive all the proper spiritual food they need. Believers grow into disciples through the truth adequately dispensed, a process that cannot occur through some manufactured approach that involves cult-like behavior by trying to encroach into other people’s lives (busybody legalism). 

*not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money* 

Since only those mature and prepared enough may teach, it is pretty obvious why those who habitually practice the things above are disqualified. And there are already plenty of people out there that teach the health and wealth gospel, a trap any pastor can fall into. 1 Timothy 6:10 states, *“For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.”* Of course, a good pastor deserves his flock's support (both financially and spiritually) (**1 Timothy 5:18**). However, he must not take advantage of this or make that his primary concern because doing so will cause compromise. A good spiritual leader knows that life is all about Jesus Christ and that to serve Him is to carry out one’s duty faithfully, not under compulsion (**1 Peter 5:2**). 

*He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?)* 

There is a common misunderstanding about this passage above. For one thing, Proverbs 22:6 does say to “*train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it*.” So if a father isn’t rearing his children as he should, he has no business managing a church since he cannot bring up his own kids. For him, this would be hypocritical since pastor-teachers must be “above reproach.” So the parents need to put in the effort in a godly way. 

On the other hand, some pastors have done all they could to raise their children in a godly manner. Despite this, people still have the free will to rebel and turn away from the truth in a dramatic fashion. Does this mean that if a pastor has rebellious adult children (assuming they've moved out and on with their lives), he should step down? The answer is an obvious no because he did his job as he should have. Our Proverbs passage doesn’t guarantee that all children properly trained will keep to their proper “abode” into their adult years. That all has to do with free will, something no parent can control, especially once their children have grown into adulthood, where they begin to make their own decisions. Many youngsters may start well but then take a nose-dive after striking out independently (people are free to change their minds). 

 *He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.* 

Newer believers can begin ministering to others through prayer and giving. But to become a teacher, those with this gift need time to undergo the proper training they will need to execute their duties proficiently. The time, preparations, and spiritual progress it takes for all prospective teachers to begin the mature and primary ministry God has for them varies from person to person. Any “up and coming” pastor can teach to some degree. What matters is that what they speak to others is within their range of knowledge. But no one should ever teach anything they don’t yet understand or believe. And whatever they do, all teachers in training need to ensure that what they say is true and not false. It is one thing to mess up in front of close brothers and sisters with a high maturity level since they are more likely to handle it well. But getting things wrong around unbelievers may only hinder them from coming to Christ because of a poor testimony. What we teach others can make or break them, depending on what we say. Misinterpretation causes enough damage already, a trend presently widespread within the church. 

Newer converts have yet to undergo the intense spiritual tests that come the way of all those who have come into their own ministries through painstaking progress. The truth is that they aren’t battle-tested enough to help others properly, as the Lord desires them to do when they are ready. You can’t help others when you need help yourself. Believers still in the infant stage need to grow under a primary teacher before they are prepared to strike out on their own and take their studies and preparations to another level. 

Many newer believers don’t know what to expect (even if they counted the cost) because they have yet to experience the many difficulties of the Christian life. “Hands on” experience is the best teacher; a hazardous stage because these people are at a very vulnerable time of just beginning to learn the “ropes” of spiritual combat. It won’t take long until they have to face the more challenging hardships that come with spiritual advancement, a fact the evil one knows all too well because he attempts to take advantage of these situations. If he can get them to turn around as quickly as possible, he doesn’t need to worry about them posing any more of a threat to his agenda. More seasoned brothers and sisters have learned the lesson of humility through suffering and discipline to approach their ministries with clarity of thought. But newer believers have yet to learn these lessons through experience. So if they attempt to jump into something they aren’t ready for, they are more likely to approach the task with improper motives stemming from pride. So there is a great danger for a newer convert who begins to think he knows more than what he does. The problem will then grow worse when he refuses to listen to those over him, leading him to form all kinds of dangerous ideas and beliefs that give birth to unscriptural conclusions. 

Many ill-prepared pastors are roaming among the ranks of Laodicea, eager to gain a large following through deception, charisma and popularity. But these inexperienced leaders still have yet to learn the lesson that the greatest are those who serve by humbling themselves (**Matthew 23:12**). Sadly, many have turned this truth upside down to mean that leadership is all about self-glory. And this is an unmistakable sign that these wishful thinkers are unqualified. But, of course, just because someone isn’t suitable to be in the position they are, doesn’t mean they don’t have the gift of teaching. Many certainly don’t, but some have the gift but aren’t adequately prepared. 

Finally, in our Timothy passage, outsiders may refer to those outside Christ’s body and those within it as part of another congregation. However, it most likely refers to unbelievers. Suppose a Christian man doesn’t behave well with those who don’t share the same spiritual relationship. How can he expect to thrive within his own spiritual family when his behavior is insincere? In all reality, he would be a hypocrite who deceptively performs a dance and a song in front of his brothers and sisters because he puts on a false show of godliness that goes only as deep as the skin on his body. So again, teachers cannot live double lives because they must walk as role models to those under their charge. 



### **4. Taming the Tongue** 

taming-the-tongue

**James 3:5-12** suggests that the tongue is the most challenging part of the body for any human to control, and for a good reason. However, the battle always starts in the mind, where the results work their way down into our hearts (the place of our volition) and then express themselves through ours words and actions. That is why virtue thinking is such a critical practice of the Christian life, because if we attune our heart and mind to the Holy Spirit (**Proverbs 3:5-6**), we will speak and act as we should. So, in this case, we are what we think because what we believe determines what we do. We’ve all heard the phrase, “*You are what you eat*,” because our diets will help decide whether or not we are energetic or sluggish. Good physical nutrition will benefit our body far more than if we eat junk food all the time. So thinking on things above (**Colossians 3:2**) will be determined by dwelling on all that is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, and excellent or praiseworthy (**Philippians 4:8**).

As believers, we all encounter situations where Satan and our flesh want us to react most negatively to the circumstances around us, and one of the most obvious ways we do this is through speech. Our perspective of any given circumstance is always crucial because things are not always as they seem. We may fool ourselves into believing that a situation is something it isn’t, or that conditions are worse than they are. Humans suffer a big problem when discerning realities they perceive as this or that. But if we keep things in perspective, we won’t “*make a mountain out of a mole-hill*.” It is always best to be realistically optimistic to a degree where we ready ourselves for any activity by excepting that people can be rude and mean. We will face stressful times and situations. Stress is a reality, but we must learn to handle it with grace. And if someone “slaps us in the face,” we must turn the other cheek (**Matthew 5:38-40**). We should love our enemies and not return evil for evil. Though we may not feel like loving someone, we must not harbor bitterness or anger toward them because ongoing grudges tend to make matters worse, not better. Anger and frustration are not sins by themselves but must be kept under control and done away with before they lead to sin. Bitterness and resentment have no place in our hearts because no one can be that way for long without thinking badly of the other person. Yes, we may try to fool ourselves into believing that viewing someone negatively (in a sinful manner) is not a sin since we never spoke a word to them. But that is no different than saying adultery consists only of physical intercourse with another person not married to us, instead of mental and physical activity. Jesus said that whoever looks at a woman and lusts after her has committed adultery in his heart (**Matthew 5:27-28**). And whoever hates his brother murders in his own heart (**1 John 3:15**). 

For believers, having proper thoughts and motives ahead of time will prepare us for any harrowing ordeal that may come so that when they do, we will react to them as we should. But if we fail to attune ourselves to the Spirit by throwing off all self-control out of a selfish desire to put self before God, then our minds will turn sour, and then we will express our inner thoughts through all manner of poorly chosen words. Therefore, we must learn to think about godly things while under the Spirit’s control so that we do not act based on our desires but the Spirit’s. Indeed, this can take a tremendous amount of self-control so that we will have to resist all impure thoughts just as we would any other temptation. 

We have all heard the saying, “*Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me*.” That statement is false because words do hurt people. But what do we mean here? We don’t imply that offended parties should take it so personally that they allow it to knock them off their spiritual course and harbor bitterness, hate, and resentment to the other person. Of course, this also means not returning wrong for wrong, but turning the other cheek. It is not sinful to experience hurt feelings because those tend to be natural reactions to something someone said to us, even if they were true. But the offended person must still carefully consider how they will react to such behavior. There is a godly way to go about it and an unbiblical way to do so. We will experience pain from others occasionally, but we must not become overly sensitive so that we fall into self-pity by developing a “martyr syndrome.” We should never justify wrongdoing from others, but we must learn to forgive them even if they don’t apologize (**Matthew 6:14-15**). Nobody deserves forgiveness, as the parable of the unmerciful servant shows (**Matthew 18:21-35**). Christ forgave us a debt we couldn’t pay back, so we should forgive others who don’t deserve it either. 

It is not uncommon for both individuals involved in a heated discussion to mess up and sin against each other by what they say. Both people need to apologize to each other, even if much of what they said was true. It isn’t just words that matter, but the motivations that lie behind them. How we choose to express our feelings toward others can indicate where we stand with God, whether that speaks of a believer or unbeliever. Such poor attitudes exist that can only describe unbelief, such as is the case with Matthew 5:22. It states, “**22** *But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire.* Anyone who means this reveals the true inner spiritual dead reality of their heart because saying this in such a high-handed way indicates unbelief, a case that falls into the category of words that condemn a person, Matthew 12:36-37. The verses state, *“ I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, **37** for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”*

The above does not mean that saying certain things results in eternal separation from God because unbelief is the only true cause for that. The meaning is that how one thinks, speaks, and acts determines whether they are believers or not (faith without works is dead). So when someone lives in an ungodly lifestyle, they do so because they chose to reject Christ and so condemn themselves through their decision to serve sin, self, and Satan. And those who continue to worsen only increase and confirm their condemnation which the judgment will reveal. They will continue to go from bad to worse by storing up wrath for the great white throne to come (**Romans 2:5**). 

We must remember that there is a difference between speaking the truth impurely and speaking in love. Those who falsely slander others lie because what they say is dishonest, even if they had pure motives. Misunderstandings are bound to occur, but we must communicate our thoughts toward others in love in whatever we speak. We can say many wrong and destructive things to others that we could never hope to come up with a comprehensive list. More than that, there are many ways we can talk badly about other people, such as gossiping (talking behind other people’s backs), slander, false accusation, and lying. It matters little which method we take and what poor choice of words we come up with; all the things just mentioned are sinful. But as James 3:8-12 clarifies, we can use our tongues for good. 

{{% scripture p="James 3:8-12 (NIV)" %}} 

**8** but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. **9** With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in God’s likeness. **10** Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be. **11** Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? **12** My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.                 

{{% /scripture %}} 

How a person speaks determines who they serve. At the very least, the manner of speech a person utilizes can indicate their level of spiritual maturity if they are actually believers. The passage above warns us that we can’t have it both ways. If we speak well to God but not to others, our prayers are useless, deceptive, and hypocritical. Those who don’t know how to love their neighbors don’t understand what it means to love God because our love for the Lord manifests itself in our treatment of other people. God will not listen to us if we have no intention of applying the truth. It is not for no reason that James states the following before delving into his discussion on taming the tongue. James 1:22-25 states, “ *But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. **23** For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; **24** for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. **25** But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.”* A perfect example of practicing one’s beliefs is treating others in a godly way as we want others to treat us (the golden rule **Matthew 7:12**). Words are essential, but they must coincide with actions for them to be effective in circumstances that require us to act. A prime example of saying but not doing is found in James 2:15-17, which says, *“ If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, **16** and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? **17** Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.”* 

To sum up this section, we cannot serve God and sin at the same time. Either we will submit to Christ in what we say, or we will serve ourselves by choosing what we want instead of what God desires. We can never serve two masters. Will we choose to live our lives for our Lord and Savior in everything we think, say, and do? 

There is always a time and a place for everything. This point doesn’t have as much to do with what we say as it does speaking the truth at the right time and location. We may have to wait till we communicate the truth to specific individuals because the circumstances may not allow for a smooth and effective “transfer” of words. This teaching is an area of application that every believer will have to discern for themselves. 

 One clear teaching is that we should never throw pearls before swine (**Matthew 7:6**) because those in the wrong will only criticize and abuse the truth presented to them. But some people may be receptive. The difficult part is choosing a time and place to offer them the truth they need to hear. If the Lord wills, He will grant such opportunities. But if something isn’t meant to happen, it won’t occur. In other words, we have to be careful not to force ourselves on others. 



### **5. Using Logic in Biblical Interpretation- An Additional Comment By Bartek Sylwestrzak** 

using-logic-in-biblical-interpretation-an-additional-comment-by-bartek-sylwestrzak

Logic is often intertwined with biblical interpretation, as we will explain below. But not in the way we may suppose. However, correctly interpreting all truth with its aid does not mean we sit back and exegete/interpret a passage based on what seems logical to us while disregarding the context, the languages, and everything else necessary for proper understanding of the text. That is dangerous to the extreme! We must never conclude a particular passage based on what seems right or wrong to us personally, as if the truth depended on our feelings and emotions. Instead, we must study the Word through the Spirit’s power while keeping everything in the context and comparing it with what the Bible has to say about that particular subject elsewhere. Learning how to pick out structures and themes from the text is critical in this process, along with having a good knowledge and understanding of the languages (assuming they are necessary for the interpretation). Textual criticism is another critical component (if required) that would be useful for a more in-depth teacher to have in their arsenal. Additionally, taking advantage of a good Bible teacher is crucial to learning God’s Word. All of these things the Spirit will help us use to decipher the truth whenever He leads us to use them when it is appropriate to do so. So, where does logic come into all this? 

Anytime we come to correct biblical conclusions, we have discovered something logical. God’s truth and He Himself is logical. Logic should never be used for biblical interpretation by itself (though it is possible to conclude some things with it alone), but often acts as a natural aid to proper interpretation. Studying and thinking out an issue correctly through proper exegesis is thinking logically because the methods used brought us to the truth (assuming we have it right). Logic is the only way we can make sense of those methods, especially when dealing with the languages. 

Therefore, we utilize logic when studying and interpreting the Bible, even if indirectly and in conjunction with the Spirit combined with the proper exegetical tools and the right spiritual approach/attitude. Plus, if we know a truth based on what one passage says, then we know that other passages that discuss the very same issue will line up with that other passage because logic tells us that Scripture cannot contradict itself (even if the two verses seem to disagree with one another). It is not the Bible which gets things wrong. Instead, it is us fallible human beings. How could we make sense of the truth without the ability to reason (which all logic entails)? 

With the above said, every believer, whether teacher or layperson, uses logic alongside the correct and biblical approach to discern the meaning of a passage. The truth is that we do it all the time, whether we are aware of it or not. We cannot rely on it alone (far from it). But we will use it by nature (because of how God made us) even if we don’t realize it. We don’t have to know we are doing something for it to occur in our minds because what we think of it doesn’t matter. 

However, Bible teachers should do their best not to explain the truth through normal (and especially not formal which deals with numbers) logic but through Scripture alone and the tools necessary to decipher the meaning (depending on what they are and if they are required in the first place). Logic (in conjunction with everything else) can help us come to the right conclusions. But it may be tricky and perhaps confusing to use it to explain the meaning of a verse to one’s listeners. Therefore, it is better to avoid using it to show how one came to the correct conclusions because that would be a very difficult (if not impossible in many cases) task. Not only is it impossible for anyone to perfectly remember how they used their mind and engaged their brain to discover the truth, but explaining some of it to others will most likely only confuse them unnecessarily. There are exceptions to this, however, because some people just learn differently than others. But those individuals most likely comprise the minority. Most people don’t need to see all the details of how a Bible teacher came to the conclusions they did, but the truth properly presented and supported. The fruit of a pastor’s labor will speak for itself. We will always need to use Scripture to support our teachings. Textual criticism and the biblical languages will also come into play whenever and wherever they are needed. But we don’t need to explain how our brains reasoned to use them (and anything else) to come to the truth. All other outside methods of interpretation do require logic in order to make sense of them, but it is the Holy Spirit who will empower our thinking and reasoning to use those tools correctly when the need arises.

*The fact that God cannot be fully comprehended by us does not mean that He is illogical, quite contrary. Every page of the Bible testifies to that - to the justice, coherence and consistency of His ways. Some of His logic may be beyond us, some may be hidden for ages only to be revealed later on. But none of His works are illogical, something we can appreciate whenever we get to understand them. Logic is inseparably bound to the truth - if our God is a God of truth, then He cannot be a God of truth and of lie at the same time, that's logic. If He is just, He cannot be unjust, that's logic.* 

*He has endowed us with the capacity to think logically (just as He has given us the capacity to choose, the conscience, etc.) exactly in order for us to draw true conclusions about Him from what He has revealed about Himself and not be led astray by reasoning that is not governed by the principles that He laid out. This is also why drawing a distinction between "God's logic" and "human logic" is erroneous. There are no several types of logic, just as there are no several truths. Neither the truth nor logic are relative. The fact that our logical reasoning is limited and we may err as we try to exercise it should not cause us to perceive it as being of different nature than God's or abandon it altogether - since it is in fact He who has endowed us with the ability to reason logically in such a way that we are able to understand Him to the degree He allowed us. Two plus two must equal four, whether this is viewed from the perspective of God or man. If God is just then He cannot be unjust, whether this is viewed from the perspective of God or man, etc.* 

*God set the rules, not us. So we follow the rules, not set them. Whatever conclusion we draw about God must be in line with everything else we know about Him - that's logic. Every element must fit with all the others. To go beyond that is an error.* 



### **6. The Book of Life** 

the-book-of-life

Contrary to some beliefs, there are no “two books” of life. There is only one, and it contains the names of every believer that will have ever lived once history has run its entire course. The book of life is God’s book and, therefore, the “Lamb’s book of life.” Both titles refer to the same thing. 

Many scholars often miss that everyone (all people ever to live) starts in this book because Christ died for all and it was His will that none should perish, but that all should come to repentance (**1 John 2:2; 2 Peter 3:8-10**). The book of life is just that; God’s will for all people to be saved. A good example is a will left by parents for their children. The children do not have to take what their parents offer but may choose to refuse whatever they desire because no one can force belongings on them at any time. So too, God wants everyone to receive His offer of eternal life, which He wants everyone to accept (**John 3:16**). But most have and will continue to reject His mercy. All those who do so will have their names blotted out. Only those who accept the Lord’s grace will remain in His book forever. 

The whole reason everyone’s name starts in the book of life is for God to further show and demonstrate to all men that it was His desire for them to inherit eternal life. The purpose is to advertise the mercy, justice, and impartiality of God, a way of confirming His overall character (though our Lord doesn’t technically need a book for this). The book of life will be undeniable proof (in addition to what Scripture and creation already tell us) that Christ died for all men and not just a handful out of all the people that would ever live. So when an unbeliever stands before the great white throne, our Lord will show them that He wanted them to have eternal life and not end up where they are about to go. It is another way of confirming the unbelief of these individuals by showing them that they CHOSE to spend eternity away from God. In other words, they had their chance and muffed it. So their punishment is fair and just. The evil works that condemn them will indicate their life lived in unbelief, the unforgivable sin of unbelief as the cause of eternal separation.  

Passages that mention the book of life include **Revelation 3:5;13:8; 20:15; 21:27; 20:12; 17:8; 22;19; Philippians 4:3; Psalm 69:28; Daniel 12:1; Psalm 139:16; Exodus 32:31-33.** 

It is interesting why Moses asked God to blot his name out in Exodus 32:31-33. The people were living in unbelief, but Moses interceded for them that God would have mercy. Yet our Lord answered that only those who have sinned against Him (because of unbelief) would be blotted out. That is to say, only unbelievers will not remain in God’s book, while the names of all believers will. Once an unbeliever dies, their name is erased. 

Did some of the Israelites repent while they had a chance? It’s possible. But why would Moses ask the Lord to send him to hell for the sake of his fellow countrymen? It is true that  “*Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,*” but that is not the same as dying for those who were clearly worthy of physical and eternal death. Tis true, no one deserves eternal life, but Christ has promised it to all who obey the gospel and eternal destruction for all who scorn it. We could ask, “would any believer die for an unbeliever during the tribulation?” The answer is obviously no, and our phrase most likely refers to a believer sacrificing his life for a fellow brother or sister.

There are a set number of elect and fallen angels that exist. Two-thirds of all God created reside in the third heaven as elect, while one-third roam the earth as fallen. This “one-third” rebelled against God during the satanic rebellion before our Lord blacked out the world and universe to refurbish and recreate them (the Genesis gap). The passages below have dual applications that refer to Satan (the satanic rebellion) and the antichrist (the great apostasy during the tribulation) deceiving both angels and believers. Just as how one-third of angels committed apostasy during the rebellion, so too one-third of believers will do so during the tribulation. Therefore, angels were created at a set number and do not reproduce.

{{% /scripture %}} 

Scholars have debated whether **Genesis 6:1-4** (the Nephilim) proves that angels can procreate. However, this is not the same as angels reproducing with other angels but with humans. This terrible act that resulted in highly talented half-human, half angelic offspring resulted in the imprisonment of all the angels involved because they violated God’s ground rules. Passages that demonstrate this are **Jude 1:6, 2 Peter 2:4-5, 1 Peter 3:19-20.** 

Fallen angels pro-created with humans until God ended this practice during and after the flood. But this writer believes it possible that genetic manipulation resulting in genetic mutations with animals continued after the flood up to today (see link above). This tampering with genetics would be something that only fallen and not elect angels practice. And many of the world’s rulers during the tribulation will likely be half-human/ half demonic beings. There is little doubt that demonic offspring (both human and animal) exists in our world today.

**3. <u>There is rank among fallen and elect Angels</u>**

We won’t further explain and go into further detail for this point. But there is a ranking order that exists among demons and heavenly angels. The highest-ranking of the elect are the cherubim, followed by the angelic elders and then archangels. There most likely exists a hierarchy among Satan’s followers as well.

**5. <u>Elect and fallen angels have access to God’s throne.</u>**

Both elect and fallen angels are not omniscient, omnipresent, or omnipotent. Instead, they are limited by time and space. However, Genesis 28:10-12 and 2 Kings 6:15-19 prove that they (the elect angels) take advantage of chariots and stairways.

Revelation 12:7-12 shows us that Satan and his followers also have access to God’s throne, whether they come and go with impunity or can only approach it only when God summons them.

**6. <u>Satan was the original cherub that encircled God’s throne before His fall. Since that time, the four cherubs or living creatures covered with many eyes have replaced him.</u>**

### 8. What is Required to Receive Christ From Those Who have Never Heard the Gospel? What about Babies that Die Young and the Mentally Handicapped? 

what-is-required-to-receive-christ-from-those-who-have-never-heard-the-gospel-what-about-babies-that-die-young-and-the-mentally-handicapped

This final comment we will discuss in this section of our series has ruffled many people's feathers, both believers and unbelievers. The problem with these individuals is a lack of trust in God and a desire to complicate something so simple. Sometimes, there is nothing worse than those who wish to throw the multitudes into confusion by overcomplicating every truth because it hinders rather than helps people. Confusion (which has already hindered the faith of many) has done enough damage in Laodicea already! 

As an aside topic (speaking of our desire to help, not confuse people), all Bible teachers, scholars, and apologists need to present the truth in as simple a manner (as much as their teachings will allow) to make spiritual growth for their believing followers as easy as possible. This writer believes that it is inconsiderate and selfish not to do so because it makes truth harder to understand and use, slowing spiritual growth. After all, it is not about them, but Christ, and therefore, others. There is no such thing as being incapable of using less complicated vocabulary and sentences. Every teacher and scholar could simplify their teachings through more readable sentences if they wanted to (without compromising the truth). After all, it is their job to teach their listeners, so why make learning more difficult? That makes no sense whatsoever. It is highly doubtful that the excuse, “*they can’t help it, that’s just how they write*,” is a valid one.  True, some things are more complex and challenging to explain, and there are more difficult teachings in Scripture that can only be taught and explained so many ways. Deep, intense Bible study is a discipline that requires a lot of digging and research through the Spirit’s power. 2 Timothy 2:15 states, “*Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth*.” Indeed, we must engage with our intellect every time we study God’s Word, but we must do so with an open and humble heart. 

Anyway, let’s now continue with our topic. In a nutshell, the question many have asked is, “*What about people in the most remote parts of the world who have never heard the gospel? How can they cry out to God if they never had the opportunity to be saved*?” The answer is that all people have the time and opportunities. Those who never believed did so because they never wanted to be saved. So let’s start with the basics. 

It should be evident to all that everyone knows about God through creation (**Romans 1:19-21**) and through the human spirit that He has imparted to all human beings at birth (**Genesis 2:7**). These aspects bespeak natural revelation, the first and most basic way God has chosen to reveal Himself to humanity. But our question is not, “*how can people know about God*,” but “*how can all those in distant lands who already know about Him receive the gospel*?” Romans 10:14 is the first passage that comes to mind because it states, *“ How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?”* This verse does, **to some extent**, answer the question for us. 

Firstly, it is not enough to believe in the existence of God. It doesn’t matter if anyone believes in the presence of a supreme being, nor does putting another name to Him change a person’s standing with Christ. James 2:19-20 clarifies that “ You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!  But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? No one can say they are a believer without manifesting a changed life, something only possible for those who have put their faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ. Anyone who wants to enter God’s kingdom must do so on His terms. John 14:6 sums this up beautifully when it says, “*I am* *the way, the truth, and the life. **No one comes to the Father** **except through Me***.” No one can ever approach God without faith in the person and work of His Son Jesus Christ. 

{{% scripture p="Hebrews 11:6 (KJV)" %}} 

**6** But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.                           

{{% /scripture %}} 

There is not one single passage in all Scripture that supports this false view that simply acknowledging or believing in the existence of God is enough for one to enter the kingdom. All those who have, do, and will get in will have done so through faith in Jesus. This teaching is based on Scripture and started from the very beginning with our first parents, Adam and Eve. After the fall, both accepted the coats of skin that God offered them to cover up their nakedness. By receiving the animal coats (representing the sacrifice of Christ on the cross), our original parents put their faith in trust in God’s Son by accepting that, in the future, He would provide payment or atonement for their sins. Indeed, they did not fully understand how this would occur (as all the old testament saints didn't), but what matters is that they acted in faith that God would provide a way. We see this continued throughout the entire Old Testament through animal sacrifices which looked forward to Christ’s death on our behalf. The first believers till the last ones to draw breath all have this in common- they believed in Jesus Christ. Through faith, the believers under the old covenant looked forward to what the Messiah would do through rituals and sacrifices. Today, we look back at what He has done for us. 

{{% scripture p="1 Peter 1:10-12 (NIV)" %}} 

**10** Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, **11** trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow. **12** It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.  

{{% /scripture %}} 

This teaching above may not settle well with some people because they may think that God cannot bring the knowledge of His Son to the most remote and isolated parts of the world. Because of this, they may well conclude that one can believe in God to receive salvation without knowing His Son. But that goes against the entire tenor and teaching of Scripture. Romans 10:14 makes it clear that those who wish to be saved must hear and understand the good news of Jesus Christ. Those who doubt God can provide salvation for all those who genuinely want it doubt God Himself because they put Him in a box by limiting His sovereignty. If our Creator could provide the very first humans (Adam, Eve, and those after) with something to go by, how will He fail to provide the good news of His Son to all people? God did not mix up and confuse the languages at Babel to make it harder for some to be saved. On the contrary, He did this to preserve humanity from Satan to guard and protect free-will. Otherwise, Satan (and us) would have wiped us out a long time ago. Nationalism is a good thing and one that helps to guard and protect human choice.

**7** Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts. Let them turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will freely pardon. **8** “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord. **9** “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. **10** As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, **11** so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.

Our eternal Savior can use whatever means necessary to bring the gospel to all those who want it, whether that be through missionaries, divine revelation, or whatever the Lord chooses to spread the message of Himself. There may be limits to the human brain that wishes to believe the possible as impossible with God. But God’s power and wisdom are unlimited. Once a person accepts the existence of God and wants to know more, the Lord will not fail to bring the message of good news to their ears.

The problem with those who accept natural revelation but go no further is that they have no actual desire to know anymore because they are content to go only that distance and no further. Accepting natural revelation is a good start, though simple belief in God doesn’t mean a person wants to commit their lives to Jesus Christ through faith. It is not enough to appreciate God’s existence or the sacrifice of His Son because one must accept the Lord in faith. This choice will entail sacrificing whatever is necessary to suffer and follow Jesus.

**34** Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

Everything we have written above eliminates any unfairness some may credit to God. Salvation does not depend on time and circumstances (that would be unfair) but on one’s desire to believe and the free will it takes to do so. And God will not allow anyone who wants to believe in Him to die prematurely before they get that chance. So anyone who never believes did so on their own accord. The gospel does not change for some people based upon their location and culture because that would be unfair and would require us to conclude that the Bible teaches two gospels, which it does not. Salvation has always been by faith through grace alone in the person and work of Jesus Christ (**Hebrews 11**).  To conclude, it is most dangerous to believe that diffrent gospels exist for different people, a danger Paul warned very strongly against. 

{{% scripture p="Galatians 1:8-9 (ESV)" %}} 

**8** But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. **9** As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.

The words above may cause us to ask, "What about the mentally handicap and babies that die before reaching the age of accountability?" The simple answer, (without needing to spend much time on this), is that both categories go to heaven because they never had the opportunity to believe. Some dislike this simply because it seems that God has given them a free ticket to Heaven. So they ask, "why would God set them up for success and not everyone else?" Again, the question is, "are these individuals in heaven or Hell," not, "why allow them a free ticket to Heaven." There is only one answer here and it can only be one or the other. We know that God is just and would never condemn anyone who never had the free will (the very purpose man was placed on the earth) to choose for Himself. It is true that death and mental disabilities are a result of the curse of sin that man brought upon himself. But since we are to choose, then those who lack the ability to do this will be saved. It matters little what some people may think about this. The same complaint of injustice could just easily come from those who say God sending them to Hell would be unfair because that isn't what they chose due to their circumstances. But the Lord is not unfair in sending people to Heaven for these reasons. All we need to know is that everything God does is fair and just, and that should give us peace on this matter. To say that, "we just don't know," is simply false. We can know based upon the awesome character of our God. If **we know Him well enough**, then we should know the answer to this.
