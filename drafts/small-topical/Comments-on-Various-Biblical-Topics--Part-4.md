### **5. Using Logic in Biblical Interpretation- An Additional Comment By Bartek Sylwestrzak** 

using-logic-in-biblical-interpretation-an-additional-comment-by-bartek-sylwestrzak

Logic is often intertwined with biblical interpretation, as we will explain below. But not in the way we may suppose. However, correctly interpreting all truth with its aid does not mean we sit back and exegete/interpret a passage based on what seems logical to us while disregarding the context, the languages, and everything else necessary for proper understanding of the text. That is dangerous to the extreme! We must never conclude a particular passage based on what seems right or wrong to us personally, as if the truth depended on our feelings and emotions. Instead, we must study the Word through the Spirit’s power while keeping everything in the context and comparing it with what the Bible has to say about that particular subject elsewhere. Learning how to pick out structures and themes from the text is critical in this process, along with having a good knowledge and understanding of the languages (assuming they are necessary for the interpretation). Textual criticism is another critical component (if required) that would be useful for a more in-depth teacher to have in their arsenal. Additionally, taking advantage of a good Bible teacher is crucial to learning God’s Word. All of these things the Spirit will help us use to decipher the truth whenever He leads us to use them when it is appropriate to do so. So, where does logic come into all this? 

Anytime we come to correct biblical conclusions, we have discovered something logical. God’s truth and He Himself is logical. Logic should never be used for biblical interpretation by itself (though it is possible to conclude some things with it alone), but often acts as a natural aid to proper interpretation. Studying and thinking out an issue correctly through proper exegesis is thinking logically because the methods used brought us to the truth (assuming we have it right). Logic is the only way we can make sense of those methods, especially when dealing with the languages. 

Therefore, we utilize logic when studying and interpreting the Bible, even if indirectly and in conjunction with the Spirit combined with the proper exegetical tools and the right spiritual approach/attitude. Plus, if we know a truth based on what one passage says, then we know that other passages that discuss the very same issue will line up with that other passage because logic tells us that Scripture cannot contradict itself (even if the two verses seem to disagree with one another). It is not the Bible which gets things wrong. Instead, it is us fallible human beings. How could we make sense of the truth without the ability to reason (which all logic entails)? 

With the above said, every believer, whether teacher or layperson, uses logic alongside the correct and biblical approach to discern the meaning of a passage. The truth is that we do it all the time, whether we are aware of it or not. We cannot rely on it alone (far from it). But we will use it by nature (because of how God made us) even if we don’t realize it. We don’t have to know we are doing something for it to occur in our minds because what we think of it doesn’t matter. 

However, Bible teachers should do their best not to explain the truth through normal (and especially not formal which deals with numbers) logic but through Scripture alone and the tools necessary to decipher the meaning (depending on what they are and if they are required in the first place). Logic (in conjunction with everything else) can help us come to the right conclusions. But it may be tricky and perhaps confusing to use it to explain the meaning of a verse to one’s listeners. Therefore, it is better to avoid using it to show how one came to the correct conclusions because that would be a very difficult (if not impossible in many cases) task. Not only is it impossible for anyone to perfectly remember how they used their mind and engaged their brain to discover the truth, but explaining some of it to others will most likely only confuse them unnecessarily. There are exceptions to this, however, because some people just learn differently than others. But those individuals most likely comprise the minority. Most people don’t need to see all the details of how a Bible teacher came to the conclusions they did, but the truth properly presented and supported. The fruit of a pastor’s labor will speak for itself. We will always need to use Scripture to support our teachings. Textual criticism and the biblical languages will also come into play whenever and wherever they are needed. But we don’t need to explain how our brains reasoned to use them (and anything else) to come to the truth. All other outside methods of interpretation do require logic in order to make sense of them, but it is the Holy Spirit who will empower our thinking and reasoning to use those tools correctly when the need arises. 

The following is a courtesy of Bartek Sylwestrzak (part of an original comment written by him). All rights and credit for everything below in this comment goes to him. 

*The fact that God cannot be fully comprehended by us does not mean that He is illogical, quite contrary. Every page of the Bible testifies to that - to the justice, coherence and consistency of His ways. Some of His logic may be beyond us, some may be hidden for ages only to be revealed later on. But none of His works are illogical, something we can appreciate whenever we get to understand them. Logic is inseparably bound to the truth - if our God is a God of truth, then He cannot be a God of truth and of lie at the same time, that's logic. If He is just, He cannot be unjust, that's logic.* 

*He has endowed us with the capacity to think logically (just as He has given us the capacity to choose, the conscience, etc.) exactly in order for us to draw true conclusions about Him from what He has revealed about Himself and not be led astray by reasoning that is not governed by the principles that He laid out. This is also why drawing a distinction between "God's logic" and "human logic" is erroneous. There are no several types of logic, just as there are no several truths. Neither the truth nor logic are relative. The fact that our logical reasoning is limited and we may err as we try to exercise it should not cause us to perceive it as being of different nature than God's or abandon it altogether - since it is in fact He who has endowed us with the ability to reason logically in such a way that we are able to understand Him to the degree He allowed us. Two plus two must equal four, whether this is viewed from the perspective of God or man. If God is just then He cannot be unjust, whether this is viewed from the perspective of God or man, etc.* 

*God set the rules, not us. So we follow the rules, not set them. Whatever conclusion we draw about God must be in line with everything else we know about Him - that's logic. Every element must fit with all the others. To go beyond that is an error.* 



### **6. The Book of Life** 

the-book-of-life

Contrary to some beliefs, there are no “two books” of life. There is only one, and it contains the names of every believer that will have ever lived once history has run its entire course. The book of life is God’s book and, therefore, the “Lamb’s book of life.” Both titles refer to the same thing. 

Many scholars often miss that everyone (all people ever to live) starts in this book because Christ died for all and it was His will that none should perish, but that all should come to repentance (**1 John 2:2; 2 Peter 3:8-10**). The book of life is just that; God’s will for all people to be saved. A good example is a will left by parents for their children. The children do not have to take what their parents offer but may choose to refuse whatever they desire because no one can force belongings on them at any time. So too, God wants everyone to receive His offer of eternal life, which He wants everyone to accept (**John 3:16**). But most have and will continue to reject His mercy. All those who do so will have their names blotted out. Only those who accept the Lord’s grace will remain in His book forever. 

The whole reason everyone’s name starts in the book of life is for God to further show and demonstrate to all men that it was His desire for them to inherit eternal life. The purpose is to advertise the mercy, justice, and impartiality of God, a way of confirming His overall character (though our Lord doesn’t technically need a book for this). The book of life will be undeniable proof (in addition to what Scripture and creation already tell us) that Christ died for all men and not just a handful out of all the people that would ever live. So when an unbeliever stands before the great white throne, our Lord will show them that He wanted them to have eternal life and not end up where they are about to go. It is another way of confirming the unbelief of these individuals by showing them that they CHOSE to spend eternity away from God. In other words, they had their chance and muffed it. So their punishment is fair and just. The evil works that condemn them will indicate their life lived in unbelief, the unforgivable sin of unbelief as the cause of eternal separation.  

Passages that mention the book of life include **Revelation 3:5;13:8; 20:15; 21:27; 20:12; 17:8; 22;19; Philippians 4:3; Psalm 69:28; Daniel 12:1; Psalm 139:16; Exodus 32:31-33.** 

It is interesting why Moses asked God to blot his name out in Exodus 32:31-33. The people were living in unbelief, but Moses interceded for them that God would have mercy. Yet our Lord answered that only those who have sinned against Him (because of unbelief) would be blotted out. That is to say, only unbelievers will not remain in God’s book, while the names of all believers will. Once an unbeliever dies, their name is erased. 

Did some of the Israelites repent while they had a chance? It’s possible. But why would Moses ask the Lord to send him to hell for the sake of his fellow countrymen? It is true that  “*Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,*” but that is not the same as dying for those who were clearly worthy of physical and eternal death. Tis true, no one deserves eternal life, but Christ has promised it to all who obey the gospel and eternal destruction for all who scorn it. We could ask, “would any believer die for an unbeliever during the tribulation?” The answer is obviously no, and our phrase most likely refers to a believer sacrificing his life for a fellow brother or sister.

**2. <u>Angels (both fallen and elect) do not procreate because God created a specific number of them as ministering spirits. Unlike humans, they do not need to reproduce because they can never die.

{{% scripture p="Matthew 22:30 (NIV)" %}} 

**30** At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; **they will be like the angels in heaven**.                                                      

{{% /scripture %}} 

There are a set number of elect and fallen angels that exist. Two-thirds of all God created reside in the third heaven as elect, while one-third roam the earth as fallen. This “one-third” rebelled against God during the satanic rebellion before our Lord blacked out the world and universe to refurbish and recreate them (the Genesis gap). The passages below have dual applications that refer to Satan (the satanic rebellion) and the antichrist (the great apostasy during the tribulation) deceiving both angels and believers. Just as how one-third of angels committed apostasy during the rebellion, so too one-third of believers will do so during the tribulation. Therefore, angels were created at a set number and do not reproduce. 

{{% scripture p="Daniel 8:9-12 (NIV)" %}} 

**9** Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. **10** It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them. **11** It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the Lord; it took away the daily sacrifice from the Lord, and his sanctuary was thrown down. **12** Because of rebellion, the Lord’s people and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.

{{% scripture p="Revelation 12:1-4 (NIV)" %}} 

And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. **2** She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth. **3** And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems. **4** His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child he might devour it.                        

{{% /scripture %}} 

Scholars have debated whether **Genesis 6:1-4** (the Nephilim) proves that angels can procreate. However, this is not the same as angels reproducing with other angels but with humans. This terrible act that resulted in highly talented half-human, half angelic offspring resulted in the imprisonment of all the angels involved because they violated God’s ground rules. Passages that demonstrate this are **Jude 1:6, 2 Peter 2:4-5, 1 Peter 3:19-20.** 

Fallen angels pro-created with humans until God ended this practice during and after the flood. But this writer believes it possible that genetic manipulation resulting in genetic mutations with animals continued after the flood up to today (see link above). This tampering with genetics would be something that only fallen and not elect angels practice. And many of the world’s rulers during the tribulation will likely be half-human/ half demonic beings. There is little doubt that demonic offspring (both human and animal) exists in our world today.

**3. <u>There is rank among fallen and elect Angels</u>**

We won’t further explain and go into further detail for this point. But there is a ranking order that exists among demons and heavenly angels. The highest-ranking of the elect are the cherubim, followed by the angelic elders and then archangels. There most likely exists a hierarchy among Satan’s followers as well. 

**4. <u>Fallen angels cannot read our minds or possess believers, only unbelievers.</u>**

**Demon Possession-Past and Present-Satanic Attacks** 

**5. <u>Elect and fallen angels have access to God’s throne.</u>**

Both elect and fallen angels are not omniscient, omnipresent, or omnipotent. Instead, they are limited by time and space. However, Genesis 28:10-12 and 2 Kings 6:15-19 prove that they (the elect angels) take advantage of chariots and stairways. 

{{% scripture p="Genesis 28:10-12 (NIV)" %}} 

**10** Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran. **11** When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. **12** He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.

Revelation 12:7-12 shows us that Satan and his followers also have access to God’s throne, whether they come and go with impunity or can only approach it only when God summons them. We also know from this passage that Satan does this to accuse believers before the Father to discredit their salvation. Thankfully, our Lord is perfectly fair and just and intercedes on our behalf. 

{{% scripture p="Revelation 12:7-12 (NKJV)" %}} 

**7** And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the **dragon and his angels fought**, **8** but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. **9** So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world**; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.** **10** Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, “Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, **for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night**, has been cast down. **11** And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death. **12** Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”

**6. <u>Satan was the original cherub that encircled God’s throne before His fall. Since that time, the four cherubs or living creatures covered with many eyes have replaced him.</u>**

The king of Tyre in Ezekiel 28:12-19 represents Satan, so I encourage the reader to read through that passage. Verse fourteen states, “*You were anointed as a **guardian cherub**, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones*.” **Isaiah 14:12-21** describes Lucifer’s fall for us. 

We contrast the above with the passage below. 

{{% scripture p="Revelation 4:6-8 (NKJV)" %}} 

**6** Before the throne *there* *was* a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, **were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.** **7** The first living creature *was* like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature *was* like a flying eagle. **8** *The* four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!”

### 8. What About Those Who Have Never Heard the Gospel, or People Who Never Reach Mental Maturity?

what-is-required-to-receive-christ-from-those-who-have-never-heard-the-gospel-what-about-babies-that-die-young-and-the-mentally-handicapped

This final comment we will discuss in this section of our series has ruffled many people's feathers, both believers and unbelievers. The problem with these individuals is a lack of trust in God and a desire to complicate something so simple. Sometimes, there is nothing worse than those who wish to throw the multitudes into confusion by overcomplicating every truth because it hinders rather than helps people. Confusion (which has already hindered the faith of many) has done enough damage in Laodicea already! 

As an aside topic (speaking of our desire to help, not confuse people), all Bible teachers, scholars, and apologists need to present the truth in as simple a manner (as much as their teachings will allow) to make spiritual growth for their believing followers as easy as possible. This writer believes that it is inconsiderate and selfish not to do so because it makes truth harder to understand and use, slowing spiritual growth. After all, it is not about them, but Christ, and therefore, others. There is no such thing as being incapable of using less complicated vocabulary and sentences. Every teacher and scholar could simplify their teachings through more readable sentences if they wanted to (without compromising the truth). After all, it is their job to teach their listeners, so why make learning more difficult? That makes no sense whatsoever. It is highly doubtful that the excuse, “*they can’t help it, that’s just how they write*,” is a valid one.  True, some things are more complex and challenging to explain, and there are more difficult teachings in Scripture that can only be taught and explained so many ways. Deep, intense Bible study is a discipline that requires a lot of digging and research through the Spirit’s power. 2 Timothy 2:15 states, “*Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth*.” Indeed, we must engage with our intellect every time we study God’s Word, but we must do so with an open and humble heart. 

Anyway, let’s now continue with our topic. In a nutshell, the question many have asked is, “*What about people in the most remote parts of the world who have never heard the gospel? How can they cry out to God if they never had the opportunity to be saved*?” The answer is that all people have the time and opportunities. Those who never believed did so because they never wanted to be saved. So let’s start with the basics. 

It should be evident to all that everyone knows about God through creation (**Romans 1:19-21**) and through the human spirit that He has imparted to all human beings at birth (**Genesis 2:7**). These aspects bespeak natural revelation, the first and most basic way God has chosen to reveal Himself to humanity. But our question is not, “*how can people know about God*,” but “*how can all those in distant lands who already know about Him receive the gospel*?” Romans 10:14 is the first passage that comes to mind because it states, *“ How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?”* This verse does, **to some extent**, answer the question for us. 

Firstly, it is not enough to believe in the existence of God. It doesn’t matter if anyone believes in the presence of a supreme being, nor does putting another name to Him change a person’s standing with Christ. James 2:19-20 clarifies that “ You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!  But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? No one can say they are a believer without manifesting a changed life, something only possible for those who have put their faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ. Anyone who wants to enter God’s kingdom must do so on His terms. John 14:6 sums this up beautifully when it says, “*I am* *the way, the truth, and the life. **No one comes to the Father** **except through Me***.” No one can ever approach God without faith in the person and work of His Son Jesus Christ. 

{{% scripture p="Hebrews 11:6 (KJV)" %}} 

**6** But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.                           

{{% /scripture %}} 

There is not one single passage in all Scripture that supports this false view that simply acknowledging or believing in the existence of God is enough for one to enter the kingdom. All those who have, do, and will get in will have done so through faith in Jesus. This teaching is based on Scripture and started from the very beginning with our first parents, Adam and Eve. After the fall, both accepted the coats of skin that God offered them to cover up their nakedness. By receiving the animal coats (representing the sacrifice of Christ on the cross), our original parents put their faith in trust in God’s Son by accepting that, in the future, He would provide payment or atonement for their sins. Indeed, they did not fully understand how this would occur (as all the old testament saints didn't), but what matters is that they acted in faith that God would provide a way. We see this continued throughout the entire Old Testament through animal sacrifices which looked forward to Christ’s death on our behalf. The first believers till the last ones to draw breath all have this in common- they believed in Jesus Christ. Through faith, the believers under the old covenant looked forward to what the Messiah would do through rituals and sacrifices. Today, we look back at what He has done for us. 

{{% scripture p="1 Peter 1:10-12 (NIV)" %}} 

**10** Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, **11** trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow. **12** It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.

This teaching above may not settle well with some people because they may think that God cannot bring the knowledge of His Son to the most remote and isolated parts of the world. Because of this, they may well conclude that one can believe in God to receive salvation without knowing His Son. But that goes against the entire tenor and teaching of Scripture. Romans 10:14 makes it clear that those who wish to be saved must hear and understand the good news of Jesus Christ. Those who doubt God can provide salvation for all those who genuinely want it doubt God Himself because they put Him in a box by limiting His sovereignty. If our Creator could provide the very first humans (Adam, Eve, and those after) with something to go by, how will He fail to provide the good news of His Son to all people? God did not mix up and confuse the languages at Babel to make it harder for some to be saved. On the contrary, He did this to preserve humanity from Satan to guard and protect free-will. Otherwise, Satan (and us) would have wiped us out a long time ago. Nationalism is a good thing and one that helps to guard and protect human choice. 

{{% scripture p="Isaiah 55:7-11 (NIV)" %}} 

**7** Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts. Let them turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will freely pardon. **8** “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord. **9** “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. **10** As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, **11** so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.

Our eternal Savior can use whatever means necessary to bring the gospel to all those who want it, whether that be through missionaries, divine revelation, or whatever the Lord chooses to spread the message of Himself. There may be limits to the human brain that wishes to believe the possible as impossible with God. But God’s power and wisdom are unlimited. Once a person accepts the existence of God and wants to know more, the Lord will not fail to bring the message of good news to their ears.

The problem with those who accept natural revelation but go no further is that they have no actual desire to know anymore because they are content to go only that distance and no further. Accepting natural revelation is a good start, though simple belief in God doesn’t mean a person wants to commit their lives to Jesus Christ through faith. It is not enough to appreciate God’s existence or the sacrifice of His Son because one must accept the Lord in faith. This choice will entail sacrificing whatever is necessary to suffer and follow Jesus.

**34** Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

Everything we have written above eliminates any unfairness some may credit to God. Salvation does not depend on time and circumstances (that would be unfair) but on one’s desire to believe and the free will it takes to do so. And God will not allow anyone who wants to believe in Him to die prematurely before they get that chance. So anyone who never believes did so on their own accord. The gospel does not change for some people based upon their location and culture because that would be unfair and would require us to conclude that the Bible teaches two gospels, which it does not. Salvation has always been by faith through grace alone in the person and work of Jesus Christ (**Hebrews 11**).  To conclude, it is most dangerous to believe that diffrent gospels exist for different people, a danger Paul warned very strongly against. 

{{% scripture p="Galatians 1:8-9 (ESV)" %}} 

**8** But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. **9** As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.

The words above may cause us to ask, "What about the mentally handicap and babies that die before reaching the age of accountability?" The simple answer, (without needing to spend much time on this), is that both categories go to heaven because they never had the opportunity to believe. Some dislike this simply because it seems that God has given them a free ticket to Heaven. So they ask, "why would God set them up for success and not everyone else?" Again, the question is, "are these individuals in heaven or Hell," not, "why allow them a free ticket to Heaven." There is only one answer here and it can only be one or the other. We know that God is just and would never condemn anyone who never had the free will (the very purpose man was placed on the earth) to choose for Himself. It is true that death and mental disabilities are a result of the curse of sin that man brought upon himself. But since we are to choose, then those who lack the ability to do this will be saved. It matters little what some people may think about this. The same complaint of injustice could just easily come from those who say God sending them to Hell would be unfair because that isn't what they chose due to their circumstances. But the Lord is not unfair in sending people to Heaven for these reasons. All we need to know is that everything God does is fair and just, and that should give us peace on this matter. To say that, "we just don't know," is simply false. We can know based upon the awesome character of our God. If **we know Him well enough**, then we should know the answer to this.
