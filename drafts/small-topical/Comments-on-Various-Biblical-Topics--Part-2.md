# How Do we Know Whether We Have Passed or Failed a Spiritual Test?

how-do-we-know-whether-we-have-passed-or-failed-a-spiritual-test

## Introduction

There is truth in saying that even though we may have lost a lot of battles during our testing, all that matters is that we have won and are winning the war. However, this can depend on the length, nature, and duration of the test. An indication we have won this war is that we have not denied the faith but have grown stronger and more zealous for Christ. Despite all the personal failures, what matters is that we come out of it not only still holding to our faith, but clinging to it tighter than ever before. We didn’t turn back and reject Christ; We didn’t allow the whole experience to dull and water down our relationship with God. Instead, the entire experience had the opposite effect of strengthening our walk with Him. Of course, this whole life we live as believers is one big test in reality, as the parable of the soils shows (Luke 8:13).

Peter failed his test when he denied Christ three times, but he came out of all that a formidable warrior for God as one of the twelve Apostles. So we do fail tests, and of course, there is no excuse for sin. But what matters, in the end, is that we learn from our failures and allow them to shape us into better servants of Christ. And of course, many other great believers in the Bible failed in some of their matters: Elijah, Moses, David, etc. 

We fail many smaller tests that are all part of the one big one that is life in Satan’s world. Whether or not we failed in a few smaller isolated occurrences here or there is something between the Lord and us and will be difficult for others to ascertain (if not impossible, depending).

## But can we really know for sure?

To answer the question, we should know whether we have failed because the Lord will convict us of our errors. So if we don’t happen to catch our errors, then the Lord will bring them to our attention through spiritual conviction and divine discipline, if only we heed the Spirit’s still small voice. We don’t do this perfectly, and we sin and fail many tests from the Lord -- far more than we even know. That always comes back on us. If we fail a test, it is because we knew the right thing to do and didn’t do it. We know what sin is, so if we willfully sin, then we know we have failed. However, even many lost battles and failures (inexcusable as they may be) can have the positive effect of causing us to become more serious about overcoming any future ones. 

Additionally, we must be careful not to beat ourselves up over our failures, whether we remember them or not. We do need to be deadly serious about sin, but we should never despair or condemn ourselves as unredeemable over our failures. Instead, we need to allow the Lord to be the judge while we forget what lies behind (**1 Corinthians 4:3; Philippians 3:13**). If we fail to confess some of our sins (something we all do to some extent, because none of us are perfect in our own perception), God will automatically forgive them. All that matters is that we have a repentant mindset to do better and to not continue in our bad habits. 




# Benefits of Being Outdoors - Exercise and God’s Wonderful Creation

However, it is worth noting that knowing the land (its weather, seasons, and topography) is crucial for people today, just as it was in ancient times (the Hebrews, Babylonians, and Egyptians are some of the more well-known examples that come to mind). 

As an example, the Egyptians used the timing of the Nile River inundation to plant crops. Topography has and still determines much of how societies arise, grow, function, and spread. The landscape and layout of any particular land can determine many things such as health, production, military success, growth, commerce, and the list goes on. In Scripture, we see many examples of this, such as Tire and Sidon, which sat by the Mediterranean coast for sea-based commercial trade with other nations. Many fortresses and cities were set high on hills with a close water source for protection and sustenance. Abraham and Lot separated when they chose which land they wanted for themselves (**Genesis 13**). So crucial is a topography that God would send plagues and natural (or divinely sent) disasters on certain lands to punish specific peoples. As the Creator of them, our Lord knows how important and fragile ecosystems are that He would sometimes discipline or punish a people by afflicting the topography. The Bible mentions God sending floods, causing earthquakes, sending hail, drought, and other natural and divine phenomena. 

To state a basic but most-important principle, everyone (especially believers as ambassadors who represent Christ and all He is and has made) needs to obey the command to take care of this world God has entrusted to our care (**Genesis 2:15; Genesis 6:19-20**). The reality is that most people throughout human history have done a pretty poor job at this. Additionally, our Lord wants us to take care of animals (**Proverbs 12:10; Proverbs 27:23; Genesis 1:26**). The earth belongs to God (**Deuteronomy 10:14; 1 Chronicles 29:11; Psalm 24:1-2**), so why would we disrespect our Master’s property? As Christians, we need to be good stewards of all that our Creator has entrusted to our care. 

The Hebrew word for “keep” in **Genesis 2:15** is shamar, שָׁמַר, and means to keep, guard, preserve, keep watch, and save life. God wants us to protect, save, and preserve His creation. The sad thing is that we have destroyed so much of it. 








## A personal introduction

TODO: what is this sentence? It came after the bit about playing with sticks and dirt: "Of course, I needed to outgrow some bad habits, and thankfully I did many years ago." Just seems kinda strange to me in context here, but maybe I'm just missing what it was supposed to mean/get at. I like how it sounds just fine with this sentence removed?

Ever since I was a child, I have always enjoyed the outdoors. I never played much with toys or video games, but preferred to spend my time in my family's backyard playing with sticks and dirt (or in the sandbox). As I grew into my teen years and my early and mid-twenties, I came to appreciate this wonderful place that I could almost call a second home. Once I passed my driver’s test, I began to strike out on my own hiking and fishing adventures. I began to try out new trails and explore new parks and recreational areas. I would often go outside in times of stress and spiritual difficulty so that I could unwind, restart, refresh my thoughts, and clear my brain. It was also a good time for me to meditate and talk to the Lord. I participated in various activities such as hiking, trail and distance running, trout fishing, and general exploring. 

Additionally, I grew up camping with my family once a year in various state parks throughout the Eastern United States (if the year allowed). Taking nice long walks through neighborhoods (especially with close friend(s)) is also something else I regularly enjoy. The outdoors has been a big part of my life, and that makes me very happy. 

## Lovely as the great outdoors are, we cannot let anything, even nature, take our focus off of the spiritual

Hobbies are a wonderful thing and perfectly fine to pursue in moderation. However, our relationship with the Lord should take first place in our lives. We want to invest more of our time and energy into our walk with God than anything else. And if we prioritize spiritual growth as we should, we will learn to love and put other people before our own interests. First, we must consider our family members (both physical and spiritual) and then all people in general. But it is good and advisable to leave some time for ourselves, because it is good to have balance in our lives. 

In regards to exercising and spending time outdoors, they have many great benefits. “*But spiritual exercise is valuable in every way*” (**1 Timothy 4:8**). 

{{% scripture p="1 Timothy 4:8 (NKJV)" %}} 

**8** For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.

## The benefits of spending time outside in God's creation

Parents would do well to encourage their children to spend more time outside instead of indoors glued to tablets or playing video games. While there is maybe nothing sinful with spending more time inside, science suggests (and has perhaps even proven) that spending time outdoors improves a person’s overall physical and mental health. A healthy, active lifestyle is certainly better than keeping one’s body at rest all the time. Some have theorized that more active people live longer than those who sit around and do nothing. However, it is true that some people don’t have the ability (for example, people with severe physical ailments) or the time to do this. If we don’t have the time due to more important matters (whatever they may be), then we don’t have the time. But if we have the opportunities to get outside and enjoy God’s wonderful creation, then we have to ask ourselves, “*Why not*?” 

Below is a non-comprehensive list of some possible (and perhaps proven) benefits of being outdoors. We need to remember that not all of the things in this list are necessarily accurate, but plausible possibilities at the least. So this writer isn’t going along with all this completely dogmatically.

According to [one source](https://www.sharp.com/health-news/5-ways-being-outdoors-can-make-you-healthier-and-happier.cfm ), being outdoors **can**: 

1. Reduce stress and lower blood pressure 

2. Improve mood 

3. Improve focus 

4. Support mental and physical healing 

5. Help with the aging process 


And according to [another](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70548/11-scientific-benefits-being-outdoors), being outdoors **can**:

1. Boost energy 

2. Help avoid certain vision problems 

3. Mitigate pain 

4. Boost the immune system 

5. Relax and calm the mind and body 

6. Boost Vitamin D levels 

7. Restore focus

### No matter how spending time outdoors can help us be healthy and happy, we are still soldiers fighting upon a spiritual battlefield

On the other hand, we need to remember that just because we live a healthy lifestyle by taking care of our bodies doesn’t guarantee a long life. Our Lord is sovereign, and He alone determines our days (**Acts 17:24-27**; **Job 14:4-5**; **James 4:14**; **Proverbs 20:24**). Tomorrow is never guaranteed. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away (**Job 1:21**). That is why spiritual health comes before all else. Good eating and consistent bodily exercise can indeed help us spiritually (albeit indirectly) to some degree. However, we must remember that many believers in third-world countries do not have access to good, healthy food. Yet, that does make them inferior Christians with less potential (**Romans 14:17**). God can use those kinds of circumstances to test and grow our faith. The truth is that we are often our strongest when we are at our weakest (**2 Corinthians 12:9-10**). How true this will be during the tribulation when we will lack proper physical nutrition and resources like never before during the beast's persecution of the church! 

{{% scripture p="Revelation 13:9-10 (ESV)" %}} 

**9** If anyone has an ear, let him hear: **10** **If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain**. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.

## Different biomes within nature, and how nature pointing to God has spiritual import for both unbelievers and believers alike

With all the above said, I would like to briefly discuss some of the different biomes of nature. Oxford Languages defines a “biome” as “*a large naturally occurring community of flora and fauna occupying a major habitat, e.g., forest or tundra*.” I will say right off the bat that I haven’t visited every single biome in this world (not even close), and haven’t personally gotten to experience most of them. 

Our goal is not to examine any biome specifically to study flora and fauna contained therein. Our aim is to show how nature can point unbelievers to Christ, and also how it can spiritually benefit believers. We have already demonstrated above the physical and mental advantages of spending time outdoors, so we will not spend too much more time there, but will here try to focus a bit more on the spiritual side of things. 

We can gain some spiritual benefits from spending time outdoors and marveling at God’s beautiful creation. I can personally testify that nature brought me closer to my Heavenly Father. Although just spending time outdoors won’t necessarily inherently grow us spiritually, it can still help us there indirectly: the natural world can help us if it causes us to marvel at the Power and Majesty of our Lord and Savior (**Psalm 19:1-2; Revelation 4:11; Nehemiah 9:6; Psalm 66:4**; etc.). So it is nature can be good for us physically, mentally, *and* spiritually. 

Natural revelation is the first and foundational proof of God’s existence, evidence so great that all unbelievers are without excuse for their choice to reject their Creator (**Romans 1:19-23; 2 Peter 3:3-6**). For believers, nature can positively affect our lives, and we have the right to enjoy and appreciate God's Creation. 

The Bible uses different things to represent both good and evil. For example, Scripture compares lions to the righteous, God, and Satan (**Proverbs 28:1**; **Revelation 5:5**; **1 Peter 5:8**). So it is true that some aspects of nature can at times symbolize evil and wickedness in scripture. However, that fact, by itself, does not make these elements evil and sinful in and of themselves, nor should it dim our appreciation of nature. We should not take biblical symbolism too far to the point where we over-allegorize things or get superstitious.

Holmes Rolston III states the following: 

{{% quote text="Interpretation: Journal of Bible and Theology 50(1996):16-26" src="https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/10217/35682/Bible-and-ecology-rev.pdf;sequence=1" %}}

The Bible is not a book of science, and therefore not of ecology. It does, however, sketch a vision of human ecology, and contemporary readers encounter claims about how to value nature. The Bible's vision is simultaneously biocentric, anthropocentric, and theocentric. The Hebrews discovered who they were as they discovered where they were, and their scriptures can be a catalyst in our ecological crisis.

{{% /quote %}}

I would note for the above (since this could potentially be misleading) that this life we live **IS** all about Jesus Christ! He is greater than all there is and comes first before humans, animals, and elements. We must remember that God **did not need to create us** (**Psalm 50:8-15**) -- or anything else, for that matter -- and paved the way for an eternal life **we don’t deserve** (**Romans 6:23**). God doesn’t need us, but we need Him! We don’t live for ourselves or even for creation, but for God (**Galatians 2:20; Ephesians 2:10**).

{{% scripture p="Acts 17:24-31 (NIV)" %}} 

**24** “The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. **25** And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. **26** From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. **27** God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. **28** ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’ **29** “Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill. **30** In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. **31** For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”

Everything below is not a claim that we are meant to see all the specifics mentioned from the creation around us. These are simply mentioned here as things that nature can help remind us of.

{{% /note %}}

### Oceans and Rivers

There will be no more ocean in the new heavens and new earth because we won’t need one (**Revelation 21:1**). The sea commonly symbolize wickedness (**Revelation 20:33; Revelation 13:1; Psalm 74:13-14; Zechariah 10:11; Isaiah 57:20**). Nonetheless, the depth and immensity of the world’s oceans (the Indian, Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific) can help remind us of just how deep the Father’s love for us is (**Ephesians 3:17-23**). Additionally, we don’t have to walk on a beach or cruise on a vessel to appreciate this immense biome. On the contrary, we can simply think about all the aspects of nature (oceans included), no matter where we are. David had a good habit of recounting many elements of God’s creation even when he was not present with them (for example, the sea, sky, and ground). 

We believers may face the many “storms” and “waves” that life throws our way. However, we must remember that Jesus is with us at all times. Trials and tests will continue to come. But no single test lasts forever ( **1 Corinthians 10:13**). Everything has it’s time which means that God has ordained all things for a specific period (**Ecclesiastes 3:1-8**). 

{{% scripture p="Psalm 34:17-19 (NIV)" %}} 

**17** The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. **18** The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. **19** The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all;                                             

{{% /scripture %}} 

Rivers are another powerful reminder of the creativity of the Great Designer. We see these waterways mentioned throughout Scripture from Genesis in the original paradise (**Genesis 2:10-14**) to Revelation, climaxing in the last paradise (**Revelation 22:1-2**). Rivers can remind us of the great river that will flow through multiple channels (most likely twelve that will flow from the city's twelve gates to the very presence and throne of God) into the great and eternal city that is to come, the New Jerusalem.

Since rivers are constantly moving, they are an excellent reminder that we as believers should always strive ahead without looking back (**Philippians 3:13**). The Greek philosopher Heraclitus once stated, “*You cannot step into the same river twice, for other waters are continually flowing on*.” We believers would do well to learn from this. We must always confess our sins immediately if we are aware of them and throw our bad habits and errors “onto the shore” so that they do not flow down with us. We must learn to confess, forget, and move on (**1 John 1:9**). And the Christian life is filled with hardships (rapids) just as it has calmer times (pools). Rivers are a good reminder of the life that is ours as believers (**John 7:38**). 

Probably the most famous river in all of Scripture is the Jordan. Other passages that mention rivers include (but are not limited to) **Psalm 46:4**, **Zechariah 14:8**, **Ezekiel 47:1-7**, and **Psalm 36:8**. Jesus compared a believer’s heart to rivers flowing with living water (**John 7:38**). 

### Deserts and Wastelands

Although Scripture doesn’t suggest it directly, there is a good reason to believe there will no longer be any desert in the new heavens and new earth. At least a few passages show the negativity of this dry and arid biome (**Psalm 107:35**, **Isaiah 41:18**, **Isaiah 43:19**; **Isaiah 35:1-10**). None of these passages explicitly state there will be no desert in the new heavens or new earth *per se*, but the fact that dry wastelands will spring with life in the Millennium suggests that deserts should never have existed. They are probably a result of the Genesis curse. The vibe we get from them in Scripture seems more negative than positive. The same is possible for other wastelands, such as the arctic tundra. **Matthew 12:43** suggests that dry and waterless places are the preferred habitat of demons. However, we don’t want to take that passage too far. “Wastelands” connote the idea of destruction and desolation (**Ezekiel 33:28**; **Jeremiah 25:11-14**).  Additionally, Satan tempted Jesus in the desert regions of Judea (**Matthew 4:1-11**).  

The Lord tested His people in the desert wilderness of Sinai and the Negev (and other areas as well) (**Deuteronomy 8:2, Exodus 16**). For the Hebrews to enter the promised land, they had to do so in faith. But they failed the test -- failed it to the degree that the older generation of Israel would not see the inheritance promised to them (**Deuteronomy 1:35**). Instead, they would wander the wilderness for forty years. 

Deserts are a good reminder to us believers how empty we were before we came to Christ. They are a good illustration that we are nothing but desperately thirsty people in an area dry and parched, caught as we are in the desolate wasteland of Satan’s world system. But when we think about our Lord and Savior, we remember that He quenched our eternal thirst (**John 4:13-14**). When we think about deserts, we think about how the Lord led the nation of Israel through the wilderness. The Lord used the desert to test His people to see if they would stay faithful to Him or not. We know how the story goes. The point is that all believers will have to cross “their deserts” throughout their lives, because testing is a big part of the Christian life. Yet we know that if we would but trust in God to lead us through the heat and the sand and the thirst, we would make it safely through. We must avoid Israel’s mistakes (**1 Corinthians 10**; **Hebrews 3**)!

### Grasslands

Grass found in grasslands, much like the other elements and biomes we have mentioned thus far, is highly symbolic in Scripture. The frailty and temporary existence of this plant of great variety reminds us as Christ’s followers that our time here on earth is very short and fleeting (**Psalm 103:15-18**; **1 Peter 1:24**). Our lives depend on God’s timetable, not ours. Therefore, we would do well to react accordingly to the example Scripture lays out for us (**2 Peter 3:10-18**). Furthermore, the very idea that grass is short-lived should instill in us a greater fear and reverence for God that leads us to conduct and orient our lives in closer fellowship with Him. The more we love Him, the more we naturally want to obey Him (**John 14:15**). 

The temporary nature of grass can also help remind us that even though this world and our physical bodies are fleeting, our eternal life and the new heavens and new earth will never fade away (**1 Peter 1:3-9**). There is no true happiness and fulfillment to be found in this life wherein we are separated (at least in part) from God. But there will be true happiness and fulfillment in the next! And just as how eternal life will always abide, the Word of God shall stand forever (**Isaiah 40:8**). This Isaiah passage should encourage us by strengthening our hope and trust in Scripture, a hope that never disappoints (**Romans 5:5**). How wonderful it is to know we have access to the very words of God that will live on with us in eternity! We have these words in our possession now, so we need to make the most of them with all the strength that lies within us (**Matthew 22:37**). 

##### Mountains, Forests, and Trees

Mountains are perhaps amongst the most majestic of all the biomes in the world. Nothing inspires majesty and grandeur more than these extraordinary works of God’s almighty hand. They help us to remember just how small we are in this massive, endless universe in which we now live. This truth can impress upon our minds just how big our God is compared to all our sins and trials. The difference is that God has no limits while mountains do. The Lord’s grace and forgiveness are unending (**Matthew 18:22**), and His power is unlimited. All in all, everything about Him is infinite, including His whole character (**Psalm 136**; **118**). 

Mountains are the highest points on earth, resting closer to the sky than any other natural structure. How can any believer or unbeliever not think about their Creator when they behold such a magnificent reminder of how high and lofty He is? Despite this, our Lord is not beyond reach even though His knowledge and power are far beyond us (**Acts 17:27; Deuteronomy 30:11-15**). His ways are not our ways (**Isaiah 55:8-9**). Mountains should remind us believers of the Millennial and New Jerusalem we will one day enjoy with our dear Lord Jesus forever because they are described as the ”holy mountain of God” (**Isaiah 56:7; Joel 3:17; Micah 4:1-13; Isaiah 2:2**). The Mount of Olives will be the first place our Lord touches down at His second advent for the battle of Armageddon when He splits it in half (**Zechariah 14:1-5**). 

Mountains are large. However, they will give way to their Creator, who carries much greater power. Mountains are physical, but our Lord is both physical and spiritual who can create and destroy. It is no coincidence why so many passages mention our Lord conquering mountains, and that is to help us gauge the scope of God’s power, something we can’t do even close to perfect this side of eternity (**Micah 1:4; Isaiah 54:10; Job 28:9**). As large and intimidating as mountains may be, they are nothing compared to the strength and might of our heavenly Father. They can be moved and shaken, but our Savior cannot. They have their limits and have only existed for a short time (**Psalm 90:2**). Yet, God is eternal and is the same yesterday, today, and forever (**Hebrews 13:8**). But like Him, they are majestic and beautiful (though still not as much) **Hebrews 1:3-4**. Overall, mountains help us to remember the many amazing aspects of the God we serve. And I (the writer) will add that the word “awesome” is best fit for the One who epitomizes that word better than anyone or anything else. 

Trees, much like mountains, are another great reminder of the power and majesty of God. Some of the largest specimens in the world (redwoods and giant sequoias) can reach heights up to 380 feet (hyperion is known as the world’s tallest standing tree). Like mountains, they point skyward, almost acting like fingers reminding us that there is only one way to heaven through Jesus Christ. All we have to do is look up and take the hint. For believers, mountains and trees can help us remember that it is only through God’s strength that we can do what He asks of us. 

{{% scripture p="Psalm 121:1-2 (NIV)" %}} 

**1** I lift up my eyes to the mountains— where does my help come from? **2** My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.                                                  

{{% /scripture %}} 

There are many different kinds of trees in the world (many different kinds of forests), far too many to count. This diversity helps us remember the variety of spiritual gifts and ministries within the church. Forests display a sense of unity in that they all stand together in harmony. These diverse and unique biomes bring to our minds the unity and gentleness that should exist within the body of Christ. Believers must stand together all while building each other up (**1 Corinthians 12:15-26**). And since we are on this topic, we remember that Israel is the root of the tree containing the natural branches while all gentiles are grafted into it (**Romans 11:17-31**). 

Trees can provide shelter and food depending on the variety. Just sitting under large vegetation can bring to our minds the truth that God shelters and protects us. The growth of God’s kingdom is compared to that of a mustard tree (**Matthew 13:32**). 

**Matthew 7:17** uses good, fruit-bearing trees to describe godly teachers. On the other side are the bad trees (wolves in sheep’s clothing), representing false teachers who produce bad fruit. These largest of plants bring to mind that we are on this earth to bear fruit for Jesus Christ through the spiritual gifts and ministries we all have. It is eye-opening how Jesus used creation to demonstrate so many biblical principles! Since that is the case, we would do well to accept these reminders our Lord has left us. They help us remember the truth of the present and the past, and the future. The Romans crucified our Lord on a tree (**Acts 5:30**). If we look back into the past, the most critical thing to think about is the price Christ paid on our behalf to grant us the eternal life we shall one day share with Him forever. We look to the cross in the past, focus on the biblical principles used of trees in the present, and set our sights on the future that awaits us in the new heavens and new earth where all the trees of life will exist forever (**Revelation 22:2**). 

##### **D. The Sky and the Universe** 

The sky (or earth’s atmosphere) isn’t usually regarded as the same as space itself. The third heaven most likely exists above the earth’s atmosphere, but not in space per se. Scripture describes three heavens- the sky (or earth’s atmosphere), space (also known as the universe), and the third heaven itself (**1 Kings 8:27**). Nonetheless, they both boast their fair share of beauty in God’s grand array of artwork. They are larger and more vast than any of the other aspects of creation we have mentioned thus far. Space seems unlimited, but it is an excellent reminder to us that God is even more so. He created it and existed long before it ever came into being. Our Savior is not limited by time or space because He is all-powerful in that He is omnipresent (**Jeremiah 23:24;**). 

**Proverbs 15:3** should comfort all of us because we know that God sees and knows everything we think, say, and do, whether good or bad. Nothing escapes His attention. 

When we suffer as believers, we don’t suffer alone. No matter where we are, our Lord is with us holding us close to Himself. No mountain is too high, no river too wide, and ocean too deep for God to sustain and protect us. Nothing can separate us from God’s love (**Romans 8:39**). No universe is too large that He cannot support us. When we take to flight, He is with us. If we blast off into outer space, He is there (**Psalm 139:8**). When we descend to the depths, He is waiting. Our Lord knows His creation better than we ever will (**Job 38**). 

Believers may become intimated by the size of the universe in that we don’t know the end or the beginning. But our heavenly Father does because these aspects of His creation are His workmanship. The seemingly never-ending galaxies can bring to our minds the truth that Christ and His kingdom have no end (**Revelation 22:13; Psalm 145:13; Daniel 4:3**). The new heavens and new earth we shall forever share with our eternal King cannot be defiled or fade away in any way (**1 Peter 1:4**). Every aspect of God’s character is never-ending and will never change (**James 1:17**). And as we should already know, we cannot separate our Lord from His Word (**John 1:1**). Our love for the truth goes hand in glove with our love for God because both are compatible and cannot be separated. Even though “the grass withers and the flower fades away, the Word of God abides forever (**Isaiah 40:8**). 

When we consider the magnificence of the sky and the stars, we can’t help but marvel at the eternal One who created them (**Psalm 8**). None of the creation is as majestic as our faithful Majesty Himself. No person on the face of this earth doesn’t see God when they view and marvel at His creation. Whether those who reject Him like it or not, they are staring at undeniable proof of the existence for the One they have exchanged for the biggest liar and fraud of all time (**Romans 1:25**). It is a terrible shame that most have chosen to credit all there is to anything but the One who made it all (**Isaiah 53**). Despite the hate and rejection, God made a way for all human beings to come to Him and escape the terrible fate due all of us. And when it is all said and done, our Lord will be able to speak to all those who rejected Him that He died for them. It is not the Father’s will that any should perish but that all should come to repentance (**2 Peter 3:8-10**). 

To resume our topic, the Bible compares believers and angels to stars (**Revelation 12:4**). Satan deceived one-third of angels into his satanic rebellion and will do so again during the tribulation by leading one-third of believers alive at that time into apostasy. Our heavenly Father is mentioned as the morning star (**Revelation 22:16; 2 Peter 1:19**), a title once used of Lucifer before his fall (**Isaiah 14:12**). The vast number of stars in the universe can’t help but remind us of the many angels and our brothers and sisters we will spend eternity with forever (**Revelation 7:9-17**).

The sky (not space itself per se) will be the place where our Lord will come back to receive His own and to pay back those who oppose Him (**Matthew 24:30; Revelation 1:7**). The sky is an excellent reminder that our Lord is coming quickly, a fact we should use as motivation to make the most of the time and be ready for His coming (**Matthew 24:36**). The clouds bring to mind the passages we have just examined that speak of our Lord’s quick and decisive return to repay each man according to his work. Ironically, our Lord rightly accused the leaders of Israel of not telling the signs of the times even though they could tell what the weather would be like based on the appearance of the sky (**Matthew 16:1-4**). Every time we look up outside, we should remind ourselves of **Luke 21:28** as encouragement. Our Lord will come from above and descend below to rescue His own and destroy His enemies (**Revelation 19:11-21**). 

Oh, how marvelous and wonderful is God’s beautiful creation! Nature speaks to us, but we must listen to it through all the wonderful passages which use it as reminders of who our God is. Therefore, we should relate to it well. We must take care of what God has left us with, and we must take the lessons we can learn from nature and apply them in our lives. Therefore, let us allow the great outdoors to draw our hearts closer to God. 





### **4. Christians and Work Ethic** 

christians-and-work-ethic

Believers need to have higher standards in the work-force because we are ambassadors of Christ who represent Him and His kingdom through the message we proclaim through our lifestyle and behavior. Believers need to work hard and do their best in everything they do. Now, this doesn’t mean we will be the best in our respective positions because some people are just naturally better at some things than others. Everyone has different general abilities. Additionally, we should never try to pretend we are something that we are not. 

For example, if we aren’t qualified or cut out for a specific job, trying to act like it is a good fit is only a waste of time and self-deception. And even if we are good at something, that doesn’t mean we are the “best” in that company per se. And we must never compete or compare with our fellow employees. It is one thing to have a chip on one’s shoulder to motivate oneself to do better to work harder and more successfully. It is a whole other thing to work to outperform our fellow workers. Self-motivation is a good thing as long as we do it with the correct motives. Our attitude is so crucial in this whole process. 

Many people in this world struggle with impatience. So many individuals (especially those from the younger crowd) jump into a starting-level position only to want to move up almost immediately for something they are not ready or qualified to do. The work ethic of so many young people of the younger generations is quite deplorable these days. So many younger people (however far you want to carry that word) come into a “bottom of the totem pole” position only to perform poorly in it. Despite this, they think they are ready for anything when they can’t even be entrusted with a little. Whoever can be charged with a little can be entrusted with a lot (**Luke 16:10**). There exists a sense of entitlement where these individuals expect everything to be handed to them on a platter. But that is not how it works in the real world. We must work for (earn) our way to the top. Everyone needs to prove themselves and take their turn. Many carry the attitude that the lesser jobs (cleaning and other basic manual labor positions as an example) are “easy” and not that important. Therefore, why put in the effort? But if they weren’t necessary, then they wouldn’t exist. Yet, someone has to do the dirty work. All jobs need filling. Work is work, no matter how you look at it. 

Additionally, Jesus stated a principle through **Luke 14:7-11** by saying that those who exalt themselves will be humbled, but those who humble themselves will be exalted. Many young people (perhaps even some older folks in fewer cases) don’t want to climb the ladder but would rather go right to the top from the get-go. There is nothing to suggest this hasn’t worked for at least some (it has), but is has caused a host of problems and issues for many people and companies. People either jump into something they aren’t ready for or don’t even make it past the starting position at a job because they got fired due to laziness and poor worth ethic. So many want to take the best seat for themselves without earning it due to a feeling of entitlement. However, many people who go this route don’t end up being very successful when they take this misguided approach. So many people want to exalt themselves only to end up in a more humble place later on. 

We, as Christ’s ambassadors are accountable to the ultimate boss! So why would we fail to work hard? How could we ever choose to be lazy? And we must never make excuses when we don’t have any, especially as believers! We may fool our supervisor, manager, or boss, but we aren’t fooling God, who sees everything we think, say, and do (**Hebrews 4:13**). If we want to get promoted, we need to wait on God’s timing (**Isaiah 40:31**). And, of course, there is no guarantee that our coworkers or boss won’t mistreat us. It is not uncommon for the hardest workers to suffer unfair treatment and even persecution to some degree. Maybe it is because we are believers who do our job as we should, which is why many people may look at us with contempt? Hard workers often expose the slackers by separating themselves through the amount of work and effort they put in. No person likes to have themselves exposed by others for multiple reasons, whatever they may be in any particular case. Believers who work hard will often reveal the dishonest, lazy, rude, and inconsiderate behavior of others, just as how the light exposes the darkness and the evil deeds of men (**Ephesians 5:13; John 3:19-20**). For this very reason, our fellow employees may come to dislike us even more and try to trap us or get us to compromise and mimic their behavior to relieve their guilt (**John 15:18-25**). However, these are only possibilities and we should never take them too far. Some people may indeed accuse us of being “goodie two shoes” because we may carry a martyr’s mentality (or perhaps not), something we should never do. The truth still stands that we must bear our crosses (**Luke 9:23; Matthew 10:38**). We will occasionally suffer and experience unfair and improper treatment. But if that is the Lord’s will for us to endure, we must bear it with the proper attitude. 

On the other hand, some people (assuming they are poor workers) may like it that we work hard to take advantage of the situation and do less work. Times will arise when we need to say something to our boss or supervisor if everyone keeps dumping the work on us. It is our right and duty to report any kind of improper behavior to those who work over us. And if they don’t listen, then we will just have to endure whatever we have to for however long the Lord allows. We can always get another job, although we should pray about that first. And if someone is talking to us as they shouldn’t, we have a right to defend ourselves and answer back in the proper way of love (**Ephesians 4:15**). 

With the above said, there is still something else we must consider here. The hardest workers may be required to do more work because “*to whom much is given, much is expected*” (**Luke 12:48**). There may be times when we feel it is unfair that our supervisor allows others to get away with doing less work than us. But we can view that as a compliment (depending). The best workers are the most dependent so that those in charge will call them to step up to the plate more often. A supervisor may think to themself, “*You are the best I have and about all I’ve got. You are a great worker and, therefore, valuable to me. I don’t want to lose you but would rather see you promoted in the future because of your hard work. Keep it up! Since I can depend on you, I can assign multiple and more difficult tasks that you have shown you can handle*.” However, it is also equally true that companies can exploit and take advantage of the situation by working someone to death while not giving them something they may rightfully deserve (such as a raise or higher position). In one way, it is a compliment to receive more work, and even better if it rewarded with something else other than more labor (mental or physical). But it can also be a curse if someone has to work harder but receives next to nothing for it. Undergoing these types of stressful circumstances can be a test the Lord allows us to endure for however long a time. When or if to move on will eventually become clear to us if we would but wait on the Lord. 

Backtracking to what we talked about regarding attitude, this is another area of our walk we need to be careful handling. If we approach work with a wrong mentality, our work ethic will most likely plummet, and our performance will suffer. We have already discussed that above. What we need to stress here is the fact that being a hard worker doesn’t guarantee we are doing it with the proper attitude and motivation. What if we are trying to please men? What if we care more about what others think instead of God? That will only lead to problems.

Additionally, we can be the hardest workers all we want while still not handling our circumstances at work in a biblical way. Anger, strife, bitterness, resentment, impatience, malice, slander, gossip, unkindness, dishonesty, and the like do not make for a good Christian testimony. Regarding how we should be in the workforce, we don’t need to look any further than **Galatians 5:22-23**. 

{{% scripture p="Galatians 5:22-23 (NIV)" %}} 

**22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, **23** gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.

Like the old hymn of the faith goes, “*And they’ll know we are Christians by our love*.” If we don’t have love (the most important spiritual fruit and Christian virtue), we are nothing (**1 Corinthians 13:2; 13:13**). Without it, nothing else we do matters. Therefore, we must remember to love our fellow workers and those above us (that doesn't mean we have to like them), even if they don’t treat us as we may want them to (**Romans 12:14; Luke 6:28**). If someone “slaps us on the cheek,” then we should turn the other (**Matthew 5:38-40**). Of course, that doesn’t mean we allow people to exploit and take advantage of us, but the point should be understood.

Angry people only create more angry people, which is why Scripture tells us that it is not good to be around a mad man (assuming we can help it) (**Proverbs 22:24**). Getting angry with people will only turn them to anger which is why Scripture exhorts us not to provoke our children to wrath (all people in general) (**Ephesians 6:4**). Patient and longsuffering answers turn away anger (**Proverbs 15:1**).

We should never make it our business to become busybodies sticking our noses into other people’s affairs just to slander them behind their backs. We need to make sure that we are doing what we are supposed to do and to do so without hypocrisy. 1 Thessalonians 4:11 states, “*make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands*.” Constantly worrying about others can’t help but negatively affect us in the end. 

To shift gears here, slothful behavior only leads to failure (**Proverbs 19:15; 2 Thessalonians 3:10**). Speaking of that topic, some won’t even work for themselves or others. This lifestyle is far worse than laziness, especially if one does not provide for their family and relatives if needs be (**1 Timothy 5:8**). A person who doesn’t help themself thinks only of themself because it means they refuse to help others, a sin the same as denying the faith. 

Those who allow the peace of God to rule in their hearts will be peaceful with others (**Colossians 3:15**), and that means they will not hold any bitterness or resentment toward their fellow teammates (even if we don't like much of what they do which may require us to saying something eventually). The safest route we can take is forgiveness through forbearance because failing to do so will result in God not forgiving us (**Matthew 6:15**). And self-control will result in all things good, including ridding ourselves of any misplaced discontent and grumbling. 

{{% scripture p="Philippians 2:14-16 (NIV)" %}} 

**14** Do everything without grumbling or arguing, **15** so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky **16** as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.

Everything we have written above should instill in every one of us the principle to give our best in everything we do. No matter how small or seemingly insignificant the job, we need to demonstrate a good work ethic, determination, and care for the task we have assigned to us by our “higher-ups.” Other people will notice and possibly even promote us to higher (hopefully better paying) positions if we do this. We don’t work for men as much as we do for God (**Colossians 3:23-24**). Therefore, what kind of testimony does a lazy Christian give to the unbelieving world? 

And let us not forget that we can all minister to people no matter where we are. Many believers don’t have the gift of evangelism, yet we must all share the gospel if and when the opportunity presents itself. If we work with other believers, then those are great opportunities to encourage, exhort, and strengthen them through the truth. Iron sharpens iron (**Proverbs 27:17**) which means that there may well be some (if not many) benefits we can receive through fellowship with other believers at work. Work can present challenges in this area because we are there to do physical and/or mental labor of some kind. So we may only have a few small pockets of time to speak with others for ministry’s sake. But if opportunities come, then they can be chances for us to do something (not that we have to force anything per se). None of this means we go hunting for chances to help to the neglect of our duties. Instead, if the Lord intends for something to happen, then He will make those opportunities possible.
