christian-colleges-and-universities

## Introduction

In this writer's honest opinion, Christian colleges, Seminaries, and universities are an excellent idea if they are run and organized as they should be (although unfortunately many if not most of them have been getting worse over the years). Christian education would have greater possibilities and potential if the church were not in a lukewarm state (**Revelation 3:14-22**). Despite this reality, there are many venues for Christian fellowship, academic training, preparation for ministry, spiritual growth, and community bonding within these Bible institutions. It sounds like a dream come true, doesn’t it? These things do exist in every Christian educational organization, but not to the level they should. This fact doesn’t mean every believer attending these colleges or universities carries a poor attitude toward the truth. And, of course, college, or any other form of formal higher education, is not necessarily for everyone. 

We don’t need to say much here about the lukewarmness issue rampant within the church today. Since most believers aren’t serious about the truth, is there any wonder that most Bible institutions aren’t as well? The academic side is not the problem but the mentality of those attending and running these organizations. Even though many people come out of them going into ministry, most churches and ministries they serve in are too comfortable with their old (or new) false traditions and beliefs. In other words, many of their attendees carry their poor frame of mind with them into their ministry. The academic training provided has many benefits (and may be required) depending on what ministry a person pursues. However, Christian education systems represent the church and need to stress serious Bible study based on what God’s Word actually says. In essence, Christian colleges and universities aren't much different in their approach than most churches today, which is not a compliment. However, like seminaries, it is possible for them to have a lot going for them too, and they are, in many ways, what you make of them.

Given what we have just said about lukewarmness, a student should not approach a Bible college or university with high expectations for finding a solid teaching ministry. Some do exist, but they are few and far between. However, relationships and serious Bible studies with other students open to the truth are a definite possibility. The Lord can use moments like these to bring people together for the better. Many house churches have begun this way! 

For those who feel led to this path, I hope that the points below will be of some help.

## One the spiritual side

### Some people are in fact called to preparation in this way

Christian colleges and universities have their benefits and may be necessary for those who are actually called by God to attend in order to prepare for some ministry He has called them to. God calls many believers with specific spiritual gifts to undergo formal training before entering into the service He has for them to carry out.

### However, compromising on the truth to fit in is not something to aspire to

A serious believer pursuing formal education for their ministry should not allow the institution to change what they know to be true from Scripture. They must think and choose based on where their study of the Bible leads them -- where the indwelling Holy Spirit prompts. Of course, we assume they are already learning under a trusted teaching ministry elsewhere.

The truth is not based on a popularity contest and should be prized and esteemed over other people’s opinions. Attending a Christian college or university should not be a cause of stumbling for a person if they legitimately care about their relationship with God more than abiding by the sometimes misguided beliefs and standards of those around them. It is OK to make friends, and there will be plenty of things to learn. But the truth still needs to come first. We must think for ourselves and orient our minds and actions toward how the Lord would have us behave.

In essence, the idea is to take advantage of all the benefits you can get while leaving all the negative things behind, never letting circumstances or the opinions of others take your eyes off the truth.

### Encouraging "diversity of thought" is counterproductive when the diverse thoughts are all false doctrine

As expected, many Christian colleges and universities are inconsistent and confused about their doctrinal beliefs. There are many organizations that don’t take a stand on multiple issues but are "open to various perspectives," an approach that throws many into confusion. These education systems need to pick sides and stick with them! Failing to take a stand for the sake of “inclusion” and “fellowship” is not only unbiblical but harmful and destructive. This is why every individual's job is to put the Lord first through proper spiritual growth. We trust in God, not men (**Psalm 118:8**).

### ...But taking firm positions on the wrong side of things is no good either

On the other side of this are organizations that stand firm and strong in their doctrinal beliefs. One would think this would be a decidedly good thing (compared to the disturbing lack of doctrinal firmness discussed just above)... but it becomes unfortunate when the things that they choose to defend down to the last man are wrong and unbiblical. So what you have there is a prototypical case of unrighteous zeal without knowledge (**Proverbs 19:2**). 

### Lukewarmness and doctrine aside, legalism and a preponderance of rules can be problematic

In addition to the lukewarmness issue and tendency to either be squishy on doctrinal positions on the one hand, or incredibly stalwart in holding false positions on the other -- in addition to these issues, there exists much legalism and hypocrisy in many Christian education systems. Anyone considering this type of biblical training needs to contemplate whether it is worth attending any place that puts a very large emphasis on rules, regulations, and restrictions. There are times we can “grin and bear it,” but some things are simply intolerable. The prospective student must choose wisely. Although ground rules need to exist in every school, they should never push unbiblical beliefs and agendas designed to control and manipulate people; see the link below for more information. 

TODO: what link?

## On the practical side

### Accreditation

Not every Christian college or university is accredited, although this doesn’t have to be a deal-breaker per se. However, for many people, it is. So that is something crucial to consider.  

### Cost

Many formal Christian education systems cost a lot of money. Therefore, the prospective student needs to “count the cost” before choosing a path. 

#### ...Is made worse by junk classes and pointless requirements

Unfortunately, like most secular institutions, many Christian colleges and universities throw many “junk classes” into their curriculum. Suppose a student goes to a school for training in a particular area. In that case, the organization needs to make their pupils study what is necessary and pertains to the work they will commit to after they graduate. In other words, it is not right to cram subjects that are irrelevant to a believer’s calling down their throat when much of what they learn will be of no use. As one former seminary student said, “*you’re going to learn a lot of crap*.” Not only is this wasting people’s time and energy, but it is scamming people. The more needless and non-essential courses a person has to study, the more money they pay. In other words, it is a way of cheating people whether the institution realizes that or not. Even if there are well-meaning reasons behind this system, that still doesn’t make it right. In fact, “add ons” should be optional, not mandatory.

Imagine going to a grocery store and purchasing a candy bar; the clerk then shoves a loaf of bread into your bag, which bumps your total up. Education is already expensive enough; we don’t want to make it harder for our brothers and sisters to prepare for the service God calls them to. This type of behavior does not make Christian institutions look any different than the world’s. And much of what Christian colleges and universities force their students to learn is unnecessary and may have no bearing whatsoever on the ministry they are called to. So making rules about what one has to and needs to learn (except for obvious requirements) to carry out their service to the Lord is only a disfavor and a waste of time. It is a bad judgment call that assumes the Lord wants and requires said person to learn this or that for the work He has for them (that is in fact going to be completely unknowable to those on the outside). But these are things that are between the attendee and the Lord so that it is not anyone else's business to dictate to them what they think they should do. That is not a biblical approach in the least.

## Secular schools are another valid preparation option for believers to consider, in fact

Despite the propaganda coming out of certain (obviously biased) Christian educational institutions -- propaganda that would have one think that simply setting foot on a secular college campus will doom one to apostasy and irresponsible drunken revelry or what have you -- it may in fact be wiser for a believer to attend a secular university for specific academic preparations (such as Greek, Hebrew, and ancient history) for many of the reasons we have mentioned above. It is sad to say this, but, like most churches, the Christian education system (while still serving the Lord in many ways) does a lot of harm. Going into a secular school might be better than a Bible college to avoid all the legalism, lack of credentials, poor doctrine, and problematic agendas. At least when attending a secular school, you aren't even tempted to look around for spiritual guidance (only to get negatively influenced due to lukewarmness, doctrinal laxness, and so on), since you already know secular schools won't push any spiritual agenda that looks good on the outside, but is rotten on the inside. (On the other hand, one does have to take more care in secular schools to avoid undue negative moral influence from one's peers/the environment itself).

But in any case, as we have already stated, one's educational experience is largely dependent on you -- what will you make of it? The Lord does call at least some serious believers to attend Christian educational institutions. But we must consider all other options too. In the end, everyone must make their own decisions based on what the Lord wants them to do (**Proverbs 3:4-5**).






# **8. Believers and Politics** 

believers-and-politics

Should believers involve themselves in political democracy? Are some Christians called to channel their spiritual gifts through politics?

## Introduction

Political involvement is not the best idea. The question is not whether it is right or wrong, but is it something the Lord wants us to spend our time doing? Watching the news is alright as long as it doesn’t distract us from our relationship with Jesus Christ. All things in moderation. But political participation is a different story than casually keeping up with what is going on in the world, isn't it?

## What does the Bible say? What should our goal be?

There is no verse that encourages believers to involve themselves in such secular affairs as politics. Instead, Scripture commands us to submit to the government, pay taxes, pray for our leaders (**1 Timothy 2:1-2**), and obey the king (**Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-27**). Military service is also a good thing to do but not required. It is fine and good for believers to give back to their country in some positive ways. 

Our goal as believers is to advance the kingdom through our spiritual service to Christ (**Matthew 28:19-20**). Those things are what Christians should focus on at all times. It is not our job to create heaven on earth (nor could we, even if we all put our maximum effort into it). Our task is not to “*make the world a better place*” because that will never happen. Society will only continue getting worse before and during the tribulation, just before Christ’s second advent. During our Lord’s first advent, the Jews expected a conquering Messiah to liberate them from the Romans through political action. Not only did Jesus not come for that purpose, but He discouraged it because following Christ entails suffering and service, not democracy and political victory.

## The fundamental futility of political involvement

Political involvement is very dangerous in that it does believers little good. Not only will it not somehow prevent the negative “trends” we see today from worsening, but it takes our minds off of the true goal of advancing for Jesus Christ. It is an incredible waste of time and puts our attention on everything but that which actually needs doing. Our work here on Earth involves using what we have received from Christ in spiritual service, not taking matters into our own hands by trying to foolishly accomplish only something that God can do. As believers, we are to let our light shine before men (**Matthew 5:15-16**), but in a way that honors God and demonstrates faith and trust in Him. Political involvement does not accomplish this but sends the wrong message.

The Bible does not command us to vote, campaign, or run for office. There is nothing wrong with voting or not voting. But it is false to believe that the world will get better and stay good if we somehow vote for and elect the right people. As Dr. Robert D. Luginbill of [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com) states:

{{% quote text="Ichthys" src="https://ichthys.com/mail-eschatology-issues84.htm#:~:text=In%20Christ%2C-,response%20%2322%3A,-On%20the%20first" %}}

 God blesses a nation based upon the quality of its remnant. So the best thing we can do as believers who love our country is to be determined to be the "saltiest salt" we can possibly be. But if instead we waste our efforts on politics, we will get less salty -- it's inevitable -- and to that degree, so will our country.

 {{% /quote %}}

## The coming tribulation makes politics an even worse idea

The tribulation is near, and we know from Scripture that one-third of believers alive during that time will fall away from the faith to follow the antichrist and take his mark (**Revelation 12:4, Daniel 8:10, Matthew 24:10-13, 2 Thessalonians 2:3**). The beast will attempt to unify everyone by installing a system that “works for everybody” and caters to all people all across the political spectrum. He will become the leading political leader of the world, claiming to be Jesus Christ at His second advent.

Christians who involve themselves in politics now and especially during that time are choosing to endanger themselves, given the great deception that is to come. The church must prepare *spiritually* to endure through the tribulation, not through man-made solutions. Political involvement is counterproductive to all of this and runs the risk of great spiritual harm. As believers, our war is spiritual, not political. Those who wish to pursue "victory through democracy" risk compromising their faith by getting sucked into the beast’s political system. Those who try to attempt to fight him by counteracting his plans will not only fail but will more likely crumble under pressure and take the mark. Only God can defeat Satan and his son antichrist; believers cannot accomplish this through politics. Many faithful believers during the tribulation will face persecution, imprisonment, and martyrdom. All of these things are according to God’s Will -- His plans for their lives are meant to glorify Him, witness to the world, test their faith, and increase their eternal rewards.

# Women Teachers

women-teachers

Should women teach men or lead a local church congregation? We will answer this question with the following points. 

## The basic overview

### The Bible speaks clearly enough on this issue: women are not to teach and have authority over local assemblies

**1 Timothy 2:11-14** and **1 Corinthians 14:34-35** clearly say that women are not to teach men or exercise authority over them in a local church congregation. In other words, they are not to teach and lead a local church assembly. Only men with the gift of teaching may do that. This truth does not make women somehow inherently inferior or mean they aren't as good at teaching as men when they do teach in the contexts in which they are allowed to (see below). Additionally, spiritual success and eternal reward depend upon how much each believer produces *in proportion to what they have* (**Luke 21:1-4**). God rewards those who respond to Him the most with the greatest love and zeal. Neither gender nor spiritual gifting -- two things we cannot influence with our free will in the slightest -- have anything to do with how much reward we can reap in the eternal kingdom. The only that matters is what we do with what we have actually been given.

### However, women may still teach other women and children

Women may teach other women and children (**Titus 2:4-5**).  Women that teach other women may learn the languages (Greek and Hebrew) and whatever other things they need to properly carry out their service to Christ. In this respect, they are not that different from male teachers. Effective preparation is critically important to ministry.

### The authority relationships that currently obtain will not be around forever

The Bible clearly teaches varying levels of eternal reward in the kingdom (“who is the greatest in the kingdom?” **Matthew 18:1-5, Matthew 25:14-30**). Authority between men and women was not an issue before the fall and no longer will be once eternity commences. Those who loved the Lord the most in life will rank higher in the New Heavens and New Earth than those who loved Him less. So, for example, human marriage will end, which means that wives will no longer have to submit to their husbands anymore because marriage and the order between the sexes will no longer apply (**Matthew 22:23-30**).

Likewise, a large number of women serving in the church will undoubtedly rank higher than their male counterparts, even male counterparts claiming to be pastor teachers. Again, this is because spiritual success depends on the disposition of a person’s heart -- how much they walk by faith and produce with what they have been given. 

### If the Bible actually directly addresses this matter of women teachers, why is there even any debate here?

Undoubtedly, many believers advocate for women teachers because male authority has been misused to improperly depreciate the role of women in the church. People naturally overreact to such abuse by allowing women to exercise leading positions over men. That is entirely understandable, since over the years, some have in fact treated women as spiritually inferior to men, which they clearly are not (**Galatians 3:28**). Nonetheless, it is still inexcusable, as it directly contradicts what the Bible teaches.

Ministry is all about service. Christ came to serve and not to be served (**Matthew 20:28**). Believers must not lord any authority and leadership they may carry over others because those who want to become the greatest must become the servant and least of all (**Matthew 20:25-28**). Despite their authority, male pastors must not treat women as lesser but as equals because that is what they are. Their conduct and behavior toward women should be the same as their conduct and behavior toward other men. Both sexes require equal respect. Moreover, people in leadership positions are no better than others just because they carry more authority. It's just their job in the division of labor.

## Dealing with some questions and potential objections

### Could Paul's words maybe only apply in his specific time and place?

**1 Timothy 2:11-14** and **1 Corinthians 14:34-35** cannot be hand-waved away by trying to narrow their context of application to be the just culture of Paul's time. 

#### The example of Adam and Eve

1 Timothy 2:13-14 describes the relationship between Adam and Eve, and that example still holds just as much today as when Paul first spoke these words some 2,000 years ago. God created Adam first, while He formed Eve to be a helper. Additionally, Eve was deceived, not Adam. In this, Adam and Eve represent humanity generally. Dr. Robert D. Luginbill puts it this way:

{{% quote text="Ichthys" src="https://ichthys.com" %}}

Adam and Eve are our precursors in many ways. Any woman would have done what Eve did; any man would have done what Adam did. That is why all that follows is just.

{{% /quote %}}

After the fall, God established male authority in marriage to represent the believer’s submission to God (see just below). After all, somebody has to lead, because otherwise there would be disunity and disorganization. Without leadership, neither marriages nor churches could function. 

#### The marriage metaphor: the Church is the bride, and Christ the bridegroom

The church consists of all believers -- from Adam and Eve to the last person to draw breath in the Millennium. The church is the bride while Christ is the bridegroom (**Isaiah 54:5, Ephesians 5:25-27, Revelation 19:7-9**). Male leadership in marriage symbolizes the believer submitting to God in the spiritual relationship, just as a wife submits to and follows her husband's leading. Since the church represents Christ’s bride, those who lead and feed the sheep must be men. Otherwise, the creation analogy would make no sense and would be pointless in our present context. This fact alone debunks the argument that Paul’s instruction here was only for the church of Ephesus and not a universal command that applies to all believers of all time.

### What about female prophets?

Female prophets did indeed exist during the Old Testament period. However, teaching and prophecy are not the same. Prophecy did carry higher authority during the early days of the church. But teaching is distinct from prophecy and cannot be compared to it. Only men fulfill the office of pastor teacher; only they can lead congregations. This point comes back to our discussion above about how God ordained the marriage relationship to symbolize our relationship with God (**Genesis 3:16**). Deacons (Phoebe) are not teachers, and neither are evangelists (Priscilla). Sharing the gospel involves some teaching, but that is not the same as leading an entire congregation. There is not one example of a single woman teacher leading a church in the New Testament. Also, the formal spiritual gift of prophecy has ceased to exist and is no longer available in the church (**1 Corinthians 13:8-12, 1 Corinthians 13:11**).

## In closing

Can women teach men in a local church congregation? The answer to that is an obvious no. This is all about what the Bible says, if we care to listen to it.

But are women therefore less than men? Also an obvious no. Men being called to shoulder the responsibility of leadership is not indicative of a difference in male and female equality, but merely indicative of a difference in duties and responsibilities.
