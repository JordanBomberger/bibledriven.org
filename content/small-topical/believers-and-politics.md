title: Believers and Politics
summary:
   Should Christians involve themselves in politics? This brief work argues for why believers should avoid them at all costs.

Should believers involve themselves in political democracy? Are some Christians called to channel their spiritual gifts through politics?

## Introduction

Political involvement is not the best idea. The question is not whether it is right or wrong, but is it something the Lord wants us to spend our time doing? Watching the news is alright as long as it doesn’t distract us from our relationship with Jesus Christ. All things in moderation. But political participation is a different story than casually keeping up with what is going on in the world, isn't it?

Although I am uncertain God calls any believer to channel their spiritual gifts and ministries through politics, I am not dogmatic. It is possible that a small few may be called upon to do so. But what we can say with certainty is that **most** believers would do well to stay out of politics.

## What does the Bible say? What should our goal be?

There is no verse in the New Testament that encourages believers to involve themselves in such secular affairs as politics. Instead, Scripture commands us to submit to the government, pay taxes, pray for our leaders (**1 Timothy 2:1-2**), and obey the king (**Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-27**). Military service is also a good thing to do but not required. It is fine and good for believers to give back to their country in some positive ways. 

Our goal as believers is to advance the kingdom through our spiritual service to Christ (**Matthew 28:19-20**). Those things are what Christians should focus on at all times. It is not our job to create heaven on earth (nor could we, even if we all put our maximum effort into it). Our task is not to “*make the world a better place*” because that will never happen. Society will only continue getting worse before and during the tribulation, just before Christ’s second advent. During our Lord’s first advent, the Jews expected a conquering Messiah to liberate them from the Romans through political action. Not only did Jesus not come for that purpose, but He discouraged it because following Christ entails suffering and service, not democracy and political victory.

## The fundamental futility of political involvement

Political involvement is very dangerous in that it does believers little good. Not only will it not somehow prevent the negative “trends” we see today from worsening, but it takes our minds off of the true goal of advancing for Jesus Christ. It is an incredible waste of time and puts our attention on everything but that which actually needs doing. Our work here on Earth involves using what we have received from Christ in spiritual service, not taking matters into our own hands by trying to foolishly accomplish only something that God can do. As believers, we are to let our light shine before men (**Matthew 5:15-16**), but in a way that honors God and demonstrates faith and trust in Him. Political involvement does not accomplish this but sends the wrong message.

The Bible does not command us to vote, campaign, or run for office. There is nothing wrong with voting or not voting. But it is false to believe that the world will get better and stay good if we somehow vote for and elect the right people. As Dr. Luginbill of [Ichthys.com](https://ichthys.com) states:

{{% quote text="Ichthys" src="https://ichthys.com/mail-eschatology-issues84.htm#:~:text=In%20Christ%2C-,response%20%2322%3A,-On%20the%20first" %}}

 God blesses a nation based upon the quality of its remnant. So the best thing we can do as believers who love our country is to be determined to be the "saltiest salt" we can possibly be. But if instead we waste our efforts on politics, we will get less salty -- it's inevitable -- and to that degree, so will our country.

## The coming tribulation makes politics an even worse idea

The tribulation is near, and we know from Scripture that one-third of believers alive during that time will fall away from the faith to follow the antichrist and take his mark (**Revelation 12:4, Daniel 8:10, Matthew 24:10-13, 2 Thessalonians 2:3**). The beast will attempt to unify everyone by installing a system that “works for everybody” and caters to all people all across the political spectrum. He will become the leading political leader of the world, claiming to be Jesus Christ at His second advent.

Christians who involve themselves in politics now and especially during that time are choosing to endanger themselves, given the great deception that is to come. The church must prepare *spiritually* to endure through the tribulation, not through man-made solutions. Political involvement is counterproductive to all of this and runs the risk of great spiritual harm. As believers, our war is spiritual, not political. Those who wish to pursue "victory through democracy" risk compromising their faith by getting sucked into the beast’s political system. Those who try to attempt to fight him by counteracting his plans will not only fail but will more likely crumble under pressure and take the mark. Only God can defeat Satan and his son antichrist; believers cannot accomplish this through politics. Many faithful believers during the tribulation will face persecution, imprisonment, and martyrdom. All of these things are according to God’s Will -- His plans for their lives are meant to glorify Him, witness to the world, test their faith, and increase their eternal rewards.

**5** And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. **6** It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. **7** Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation, **8** and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain. **9** If anyone has an ear, let him hear: **10** **If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain.** Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.

## **1 Corinthians 5:9-11** 

I want to point out that **1 Corinthians 5:9-11** has commonly been pushed beyond the proper limits of how believers should interact with the world (we will provide some examples below). I bring this up because some within the body of Christ have reasoned that since we are the salt of the earth, this must mean doing and participating in certain things that are (in my view) counterproductive to faith. I will explain below. 

{{% scripture p="1 Corinthians 5:9-11 (NIV)" %}} 

**9** I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— **10** not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. **11** But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people.

Many within the church support this notion that believers MUST involve themselves in politics (as but one example). To them, this is part of being a witness and letting their lights shine before others. However, it is inevitable that (because of what they entail by their very nature) the more the church runs after politics (such as running for some office or just getting overly mentally, emotionally, and or physically involved entirely), the less “salty” they will become, and that is for multiple reasons. Is it possible that (as few and far between as they may be) a few individuals within the body may be called upon to channel their spiritual gifts and ministries through some political field? Perhaps. But we need to understand that most Christians would do well to stay out of them altogether unless it entails something far less threatening to their spiritual health, such as voting (even if the Bible doesn’t command that either). There are no examples of any of the great believers of the Bible ever using politics to advance the kingdom (which is a spiritual one, not bespeaking this physical earth). 

This attitude of trying to fix a broken world demonstrates a lack of faith and trust in God to set things right. Our job entails spiritual service, while the rest is up to the Lord. When the world became corrupt in Noah’s day (**Genesis 6**), Noah and His family did not attempt to fix it as it was during their time. Instead, they walked in faith by trusting the Lord to work everything out. And that He did by preserving this man of God and his family through the ark while destroying the disobedient inhabitants of the earth. As we will see in one of our next points, we are not far from seeing a somewhat parallel repeat of that event (albeit there will be no flood).  

The church cannot fix the world. Not only is this an impossible task that is a complete waste of time for that and the other reasons mentioned, but it distracts the body of Christ from witnessing and approaching the lost as the Bible commands us to through spiritual means. That right there is a recipe for disaster for the believer’s faith. 

Thirdly, believers are not “of” the world but “in” it. There is a big difference between the two because we are members and ambassadors of the kingdom and not that of the Devil’s world system. The spiritual differences between the two groups could not be more pronounced! We Christians are pilgrims and sojourners in hostile territory not our own. Since we are but visitors, why would we try to overturn Satan's world system through secular means? That turns the believers duty upside down on its head! Our duties and the weapons needed to carry them out are spiritual. 

 We are not here to change the order of things of **Christ’s** arch-enemy because only the Lord can “cleanse His threshing floor.” What we can do is (through the Lord’s strength so that He gets all the glory) counteract all the evil attacks of the Devil by putting on the armor of God (**Ephesians 6:10-18**), which entails spiritual growth (offense and defense) and ministry (deploying our spiritual gifts in service to Christ). For more information on the armor of God, I recommend the reader to see that section in the study entitled “Overcoming Sin.” We can only properly counteract the side effects of evil through spiritual means through the grace and power of the only One who can do anything about it.

**19** If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, **you do not belong to the world**, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.

Now, believers still have to engage in this world and utilize various things within it to help them advance in their spiritual walk and ministries (we will discuss this further below). The "monk" mentality of isolation from both the world and the church is unbiblical because it makes spiritual growth, progress, and production almost entirely impossible. And it is a selfish and self-centered approach that makes life all about the individual who participates in such behavior. We must still navigate this world in a godly way, just as we need to be in contact with other believers (whether in person, online, or what have you) to properly please the Lord and be the "salt" and "light" of the earth. Taking the "lone wolf" path is bound to spell spiritual disaster!

**24** And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: **25** Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.

However, the main point of **1 Corinthians 5:10** is that we are to react to the evil around us in a godly way without compromising our biblical beliefs and behaviors. To be more precise, all Paul intended to communicate in verse ten is that we cannot entirely avoid immoral people and situations/circumstances. He wasn’t suggesting anything other than that (and this is where too many have taken this passage too far out of context). He was simply clarifying what he meant. So it would be improper to take this verse and throw it at others by legalistically encouraging (the road to spiritual peril is often paved by good intentions **Proverbs 19:2**) them to get themselves wrapped up in things that most likely don’t pertain to their spiritual calling. And some of what is preached as “service in the name of Christ” are things we should have little to do with, period. 

However, it is true that there are things in the world that will pertain to the service of various believers. And we are all called to be witnesses to those around us wherever we are (work, recreation, the grocery store, etc.) When it comes to how believers engage this world, there will be variables that will involve things that would not constitute a threat to their spiritual welfare. 

For example, studying politics (not the same as participating in them by trying to improve the world) to help familiarize oneself with a particular country to evangelize it is not bad. We can use the world (without participating in its wickedness and doing things that endanger our faith) in various ways to help utilize our spiritual gifts in the ministries we have all received from Christ. The Lord calls some believers to study different languages, laws, cultures, countries, and politics (all to varying degrees) to help them better understand and minister to those they serve. Many believers (especially pastors and missionaries) will need to learn at least some secular aspects of a particular society (such as the region's history, culture, laws, politics, etc.) to help them navigate the "terrain" in which they must serve. And we would not be incorrect to say that almost everyone has at least some knowledge of these things in whatever place dealing with however many nations. But how much each of our brothers and sisters engages in these non-comprehensive examples (there are undoubtedly far more) will vary based on the individual and their particular gifting/calling from the Lord. Some may familiarize themselves with these things very little, while others a lot more. The believer's sum of eternal rewards rests on how well they respond to the Spirit’s leading by doing what He wants them to do.

And regarding ministering to others, we should remember the example of Christ who ate with tax collectors and sinners (**Matthew 9:10-13**, **Mark 2:15-17**, **Luke 5:29-31**). The church must serve the world to become like Christ without simultaneously becoming like the world in so doing. 

{{% scripture p="Mark 2:15-17 (NIV)" %}}  

**15** While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. **16** When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” **17** On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.

This passage above involves two believers. However, the principle still applies. We never compromise with those we minister to (the world as our point of emphasis here). We are in this world, so we must (in various ways) utilize it in whatever manner(s) we can to fulfill our spiritual duties to Christ (whatever all the particulars and details look like for each and every individual).
