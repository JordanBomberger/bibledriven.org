Should believers involve themselves in political democracy? Are some Christians called to channel their spiritual gifts through politics?

## Most within the church would do well not to get physically, mentally, or emotionally involved in politics  

Political involvement is not the best idea for most believers. The question is not whether it is right or wrong but whether it is something the Lord wants us to spend our time doing. Watching the news is alright as long as it doesn’t distract us from our relationship with Jesus Christ (all things in moderation). But political participation is a different story than casually keeping up with what is happening worldwide, isn't it? 

Now, allow me to clarify that I do believe that God may (as a possibility) call a small handful of Christians (I base my reasoning on the probability because of how many born-again believers, spiritual gifts, and ministries exist in the world) to channel their spiritual gifts through politics of some type and degree (be they ever so few and far between). The sheer volume of believers alive in this world makes this all the more convincing. I believe it is overly dismissive to dogmatically believe that absolutely none of our brothers and sisters in Christ, out of the millions that live on this planet, aren’t called to minister to others through some political field (whatever that looks like) to some degree.  It is difficult to dismiss this point based on all likely probabilities. I see no problem with it as long as the believer in question (assuming it is their calling) goes into it trusting the Lord without this crazy belief that they are going to somehow make the world a better place to create heaven on earth. 

Very few believers should pursue and (mentally, physically, and emotionally) involve themselves in politics to begin with because most of it entails trying to “change the world for the better.” Most Christians cannot get involved without it doing more harm than good (we presently see just how much damage political action has done in our lukewarm era of Laodicea **Revelation 3:14-22**). Believers are called to be the salt of the earth, something accomplished only through spiritual growth, progress, and production. If a person can minister to others through some political field/scheme while advancing the kingdom through spiritual means without carrying the crazy attitude we just mentioned (let’s make the world a better place), then there should be few problems despite the dangers and risks involved as long as they allow the Spirit empowering their spiritual growth to guide them through it without compromising. 

However, it is also true that bad company corrupts good morals (**1 Corinthians 15:33**). But sometimes, we can only reach some people if we go to them (which may involve taking some risks (**Matthew 9:10-17**). We see this with many missionaries today and in times past who have exposed themselves to many spiritually dangerous situations (witnessing to witch doctors in demonically influenced villages as but one example). Some ministries involve risk, so while the example we just gave is still a far cry from the dangers wrought in politics, there is a good chance a small number of believers can handle it because it corresponds to their calling. We have different spiritual gifts for a reason. Some people are better at doing things that others cannot do (things that the majority would do well to avoid for their spiritual safety). One man can witness in a bar without batting an eye at taking a drink or defiling his conscience. Another cannot do so because the temptation is too much for him. Every believer should exercise discernment based on what the Spirit leads them to do. 

So, what would the details look like, and how would these brothers and sisters of ours serve while avoiding the many dangers and pitfalls of their callings (much of this will depend on what area of politics they pursue and “how” and “how much” they are involved)? Those are things we, on the outside, cannot necessarily know for certain, nor should we try to pin down with any absolute dogmatism. It would be a dangerous and pointless waste of time to try and figure out a lot of information that will be unknowable to us (generally speaking), so much so that it would become a futile, distracting, pointless, waste of time. I would encourage any brother or sister not to get their heads wrapped around the question, "How can any believer serve in politics without stumbling?” None of that is to say we cannot come up with any possibly reasonable answers, but trying to “figure these things out” is a tremendous waste of time and a complete distraction to spiritual growth. Needless to say, whichever side of the debate one wishes to take, it is best not to take a firm dogmatic stance on this issue. 

##  **What About the Old Testament?** 

Some have reasoned that because Israel had kings and exercised diplomacy through negotiating with other nations, we, the present-day church, should take this as an all-encompassing example and apply it ourselves. However, we are not the nation of Israel, nor are there any direct commands or exhortations anywhere in the New Testament to pursue politics to advance God’s kingdom. Under the old covenant, Israel received direct commands from God for specific purposes applicable only to them during their period (however many years). That is not the same as reading some teaching, command, or doctrine set in stone as we see throughout the Bible (especially the New Testament). Israel’s calling and situation were quite different than the circumstances the church lives under today, so it would be terribly wrong to imitate actions only applicable to specific people for a certain period. 

For example, there are many rituals and practices commanded in the Law that are no longer binding on any of us today. Therefore, we cannot just jump back to the Law of the old covenant and the old days of Israel and take everything and say it must still be something to carry out. And if church history tells us anything (and it most certainly does), we would be right to see that politics have done more harm than good throughout the past 2,000 years of her history. The church must resist the urge to take matters into its own hands by jumping to action without any direct divine authorization. The Crusades, for example, were a complete failure and were unjustified because God did not “sanction” them. 

## **What does the Bible say? What should our goal be?**

No verse in the New Testament encourages believers to involve themselves in politics (nor are there any examples of any who did so). Instead, Scripture commands us to submit to the government, pay taxes, pray for our leaders (**1 Timothy 2:1-2**), and obey the king (**Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-27**). Military service is also a good thing to do but not required (unless living in a country where service is mandatory for a set time). However, it is doubtful much good spiritual change will come through participating in marches and “movements” that seek to solve many specific moral issues (abortion and racism are but two examples). We are not commanded to do this in Scripture, probably because it inevitably leads to distraction and compromise at some level. Yes, there is much wickedness in this world. Abortion and racism are clearly wrong, but the biblical and most effective way to counter Satan’s world system is through the power of his arch-enemy, the Holy Spirit of our God, Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We do not wrestle against flesh and blood (**Ephesians 6:12**), so why do so many of our brothers and sisters wish to counter Satan through so many of the same methods utilized by his followers? In my view, protesting like unbelievers makes the church look more like they belong to the world. Does this mean there is never a time and place for protests? I cannot rule that out completely, but it would not be a good general practice. 

How we push to change the world is something we must accomplish through spiritual growth, progress, and production so that our very thoughts, words, and actions (which will speak for themselves) will leave many of those around us in little doubt as to who we (the church) serve. We know the old hymn of the faith that says, “They Will Know We Are Christians By Our Love.” Instead of playing the devil’s world game by shouting back at the audience, it would seem that the best way to convict people to help in their repentance (surely the Lord is with these people **Matthew 5:16**!) is to reach them through spiritual means without aggressively pushing back against their own behavior. Understandably, believers have the right to inwardly react with “righteous indignation” to the injustices in the world. But we must learn to respond through putting on the armor of God (**Ephesians 6:10-18**).   

Our goal as believers is to advance the kingdom through our spiritual service to Christ (**Matthew 28:19-20**). Those things are what Christians should focus on at all times. It is not our job to create heaven on Earth (nor could we, even if we all put our maximum effort into it). Our task is not to “*make the world a better place*” because that will never happen. Society will only worsen before and during the tribulation, just before Christ’s second advent. During our Lord’s first advent, the Jews expected a conquering Messiah to liberate them from the Romans through political action. Not only did Jesus not come for that purpose, but He discouraged it because following Christ entails suffering and service, not democracy and political victory.

## **The fundamental futility of political involvement**

Political involvement is very dangerous in that it does believers little good. Not only will it not somehow prevent the negative “trends” we see today from worsening, but it will take our minds off of the true goal of advancing for Jesus Christ. It is an incredible waste of time and puts our attention on everything but that which needs doing. Our work here on Earth involves using what we have received from Christ in spiritual service, not taking matters into our own hands by trying to accomplish only something God can do. As believers, we are to let our light shine before men (**Matthew 5:15-16**), but in a way that honors God and demonstrates faith and trust in Him. Political involvement does not accomplish this but sends the wrong message.

The Bible does not command us to vote, campaign, or run for office. There is nothing wrong with voting or not voting. But it is false to believe that the world will get better and stay good if we somehow vote for and elect the right people. As Dr. Luginbill of [Ichthys.com](https://ichthys.com/) states:

{{% quote text="Ichthys" src="[https://ichthys.com/mail-eschatology-issues84.htm#:~:text=In%20Christ%2C-,response%20%2322%3A,-On%20the%20first](https://ichthys.com/mail-eschatology-issues84.htm#:~:text=In Christ%2C-,response %2322%3A,-On the first)" %}}

God blesses a nation based upon the quality of its remnant. So the best thing we can do as believers who love our country is to be determined to be the "saltiest salt" we can possibly be. But if instead we waste our efforts on politics, we will get less salty -- it's inevitable -- and to that degree, so will our country.

## **The coming tribulation makes politics an even worse idea**

The tribulation is near, and we know from Scripture that one-third of believers alive during that time will fall away from the faith to follow the antichrist and take his mark (**Revelation 12:4, Daniel 8:10, Matthew 24:10-13, 2 Thessalonians 2:3**). The beast will attempt to unify everyone by installing a system that “works for everybody” and caters to all people all across the political spectrum. He will become the leading political leader of the world, claiming to be Jesus Christ at His second advent.

Christians who involve themselves in politics now (bad enough at any time but especially now since the Tribulation is so near), especially during the Tribulation, are choosing to endanger themselves, given the great deception to come. The church must prepare *spiritually* to endure through the tribulation, not through man-made solutions. Political involvement is counterproductive to all of this and runs the risk of great spiritual harm. As believers, our war is spiritual, not political. Those who wish to pursue "victory through democracy" risk compromising their faith by getting sucked into the beast’s political system. Those who try to fight him by counteracting his plans will fail and more likely crumble under pressure and take the mark. Only God can defeat Satan and his son, antichrist; believers cannot accomplish this through politics. Many faithful believers will face persecution, imprisonment, and martyrdom during this dark period. All of these things are according to God’s Will -- His plans for their lives are meant to glorify Him, witness to the world, test their faith, and increase their eternal rewards.

**5** And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. **6** It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. **7** Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation, **8** and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain. **9** If anyone has an ear, let him hear: **10** **If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain.** Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.

Ultimately, political involvement of any kind does NOT fix the lukewarm problem so rampant within the church because it does not address the spiritual issue of getting serious about seeking out, understanding, believing, and applying the truth (**Revelation 3:14-22**). Politics is distracting and counterproductive to the solution to the present state of the church and, for that reason, will not stave off the horrors of the tribulation (meant as discipline for believers and punishment for unbelievers) to come. The consequences of failing to be "red hot" will manifest themselves regardless of the people who lead our country (whether those people are good, bad, or somewhere in between). Had spiritual means been pursued as a way to react to the unrighteousness in this world, then we, the present day era of believers, would never have had to face the tribulation. But combining the truth and ministry needed to dispense it with worldly methods of creating solutions is bound to cause much harm and already has. 

The takeaway is that political involvement (no matter how many believers choose that course) can never fix the current problem with the present day church because worldly solutions are counterproductive to the process needed to achieve the spiritual change required for the world's believers to become "earnest and repent." What makes anyone think that political involvement is going to make any believer more serious about their relationship with the Lord and the truth needed for that to happen?

## **1 Corinthians 5:9-11** 

I want to point out that many have pushed **1 Corinthians 5:9-11** beyond the proper limits of how believers should interact with the world (we will provide some examples below). I bring this up because many have reasoned that since we are the salt of the earth, this must mean doing and participating in certain things that are (in my view) counterproductive to faith. Politics is one of these things. 

{{% scripture p="1 Corinthians 5:9-11 (NIV)" %}} 

**9** I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— **10** not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. **In that case you would have to leave this world**. **11** But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people. 

{{% /scripture %}} 

The main point of **1 Corinthians 5:10** is that we are to react to the evil around us in a godly way without compromising our biblical beliefs and behaviors. To be more precise, all Paul intended to communicate in verse ten is that we cannot entirely avoid immoral people and situations/circumstances. He wasn’t suggesting anything other than that (and this is where too many have taken this passage too far out of context). He was simply clarifying what he meant. So it would be improper to take this verse and throw it at others by legalistically encouraging (the road to spiritual peril is often paved by good intentions **Proverbs 19:2**) them to get themselves wrapped up in things that most likely don’t pertain to their spiritual calling. And some of what is preached as “service in the name of Christ” are things we should have little to do with, period. 

However, it is true that there are things in the world that will pertain to the service of various believers. And we are all called to be witnesses to those around us wherever we are (work, recreation, the grocery store, etc.) When it comes to how believers engage this world, there will be variables that will involve things that would not threaten their spiritual welfare. 

For example, studying politics (not the same as participating in them by trying to improve the world) to help familiarize oneself with a particular country to evangelize it is not bad. We can use the world (without participating in its wickedness and doing things that endanger our faith) in various ways to help utilize our spiritual gifts in the ministries we have all received from Christ. The Lord calls some believers to study different languages, laws, cultures, countries, and politics (all to varying degrees) to help them better understand and minister to those they serve. Many believers (especially pastors and missionaries) will need to learn at least some secular aspects of a particular society to help them navigate the "terrain" in which they must serve. And we would not be incorrect to say that almost everyone has at least some knowledge of these things in whatever place dealing with however many nations. Naturally, how much each of our brothers and sisters engages in these non-comprehensive examples (there are undoubtedly far more) will vary based on the individual and their particular gifting/calling from the Lord. Some may familiarize themselves with these things very little, while others a lot more. The believer's sum of eternal rewards rests on how well they respond to the Spirit’s leading by doing what He wants them to do.

Regarding ministering to others, we should remember the example of Christ, who ate with tax collectors and sinners (**Matthew 9:10-13**, **Mark 2:15-17**, **Luke 5:29-31**). The church must serve the world to become like Christ without simultaneously becoming like the world in so doing. Politics inevitably dulls the believer’s spiritual sensitivity to the true purpose and mission of the church.

**15** While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. **16** When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” **17** On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. 

{{% /scripture %}} 

This passage above involves two believers. However, the principle still applies. We never compromise with those we minister to (the world as our point of emphasis here). We are in this world, so we must (in various ways) utilize it in whatever manner(s) we can to fulfill our spiritual duties to Christ (whatever all the particulars and details look like for every individual). 

Regarding politics again (something almost impossible to participate in without damaging faith), this attitude of trying to fix a broken world demonstrates a lack of faith and trust in God to set things right. Our job entails spiritual service, while the rest is up to the Lord. When the world became corrupt in Noah’s day (**Genesis 6**), Noah and His family did not attempt to fix it as it was during their time. Instead, they walked in faith by trusting the Lord to work everything out. And that He did by preserving this man of God and his family through the ark while destroying the disobedient inhabitants of the Earth. We are not far from seeing a somewhat parallel repeat of that event (albeit there will be no flood). 

The church cannot fix the world. Not only is this an impossible task that is a complete waste of time for that and the other reasons mentioned, but it distracts the body of Christ from witnessing and approaching the lost as the Bible commands us to through spiritual means. That right there is a recipe for disaster for the believer’s faith. 

Believers are not “of” the world but “in” it. There is a big difference between the two because we are members and ambassadors of the kingdom and not that of the Devil’s world system. The spiritual differences between the two groups could not be more pronounced! We Christians are pilgrims and sojourners in hostile territory. Since we are but visitors, why would we try to overturn Satan's world system through secular means? That turns the believer's duty upside down on its head! Our duties and the weapons needed to carry them out are spiritual.

Now, believers still have to engage in this world and utilize various things within it to help them advance in their spiritual walk and ministries (we already discussed that above). The "monk" mentality of isolation from both the world and the church is unbiblical because it makes spiritual growth, progress, and production almost entirely impossible. And it is a selfish and self-centered approach that makes life all about the individual who participates in such behavior. We must still navigate this world in a godly way, just as we need to be in contact with other believers (whether in person, online, or what have you) to properly please the Lord and be the "salt" and "light" of the earth. Taking the "lone wolf" path is bound to spell spiritual disaster! 

## **So How Should Our Spiritual lives carry into our general lives?** 

In case of any misunderstanding with the above, I will point out that the believer’s spiritual life is a 24/7 affair that must be lived anywhere regardless of circumstances, not just at home when praying, reading our Bibles, and ministering in our own unique and specific ways. Spiritual growth, progress, and production should occur **at** any time **or** place (and should not be separated from life in general). Spiritual growth is intertwined with every aspect of life because just praying, reading our Bibles, and being fed from a good teaching source is insufficient to get any believer anywhere. Without proper application of the truth, we would never grow spiritually. Therefore, growth, progress, and production can and will occur no matter where we are (whether at school, work, or elsewhere).

Anywhere we go, we can minister to others, apply the truth we have learned from the Word, and learn important lessons through our application of Scripture. It doesn’t matter if we aren’t reading our Bibles at every moment of the day, of course, because anything we do can still entail spiritual growth, progress, and production. Additionally, James states that faith without works is useless. We can accomplish all three by properly thinking, talking, and behaving as our Lord would want us to. So, yes, Bible reading, prayer, and personal ministry must occur, but that must all carry into how we live our lives everywhere we go.

**Conclusion**- spiritual growth, progress, and production can occur at any time and place and involve just about everything we do (we must walk by the Spirit at **ALL** times). Yes, we must read God’s Word at home, but that and properly conducting ourselves elsewhere go hand in hand. Satan can tempt us at any time and place (often when we least expect it)-our flesh can act up on us at any time and place---God can test us at any time and location He desires. Everything we do in life (as **1 Corinthians 10:31** states) should be done for God’s glory. Anything can be used as an opportunity for spiritual learning based on how we handle those circumstances through our thoughts, words, and actions. 

To clarify through just one example, working, reading, and studying in school alone are not spiritual growth or production. In other words, they won’t grow anyone spiritually, just as doing anything secular in general alone won’t spiritually advance us. Unbelievers and lukewarm Christians do these things all the time, yet they think very little about how they are going about it. The task (**what we do and where we do it**) is not the issue but how we do it---our thoughts, motives, and attitude. 

For example, a college professor or a marine does not have a better or more noble ministry than a spiritually mature person who works at McDonalds. The venue is not what matters but the spiritual fruit and the heart and motivations involved. We can never grow spiritually without properly orienting ourselves to every aspect of life, regardless of what we’re doing. The goal of anything we do, whether it is work, school, or anything else, is not only for the benefit of secular learning, earning our bread and butter, or whatever else, but is, most importantly, to bring glory to God.
