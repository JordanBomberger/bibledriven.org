title: How Do we Know Whether We Have Passed or Failed a Spiritual Test?
---

## Introduction

There is truth in saying that even though we may have lost a lot of battles during our testing, all that matters is that we have won and are winning the war. However, this can depend on the length, nature, and duration of the test. An indication we have won this war is that we have not denied the faith but have grown stronger and more zealous for Christ. Despite all the personal failures, what matters is that we come out of it not only still holding to our faith, but clinging to it tighter than ever before. We didn’t turn back and reject Christ; We didn’t allow the whole experience to dull and water down our relationship with God. Instead, the entire experience had the opposite effect of strengthening our walk with Him. Of course, this whole life we live as believers is one big test in reality, as the parable of the soils shows (Luke 8:13).

Peter failed his test when he denied Christ three times, but he came out of all that a formidable warrior for God as one of the twelve Apostles. So we do fail tests, and of course, there is no excuse for sin. But what matters, in the end, is that we learn from our failures and allow them to shape us into better servants of Christ. And of course, many other great believers in the Bible failed in some of their matters: Elijah, Moses, David, etc. 

We fail many smaller tests that are all part of the one big one that is life in Satan’s world. Whether or not we failed in a few smaller isolated occurrences here or there is something between the Lord and us and will be difficult for others to ascertain (if not impossible, depending).

## But can we really know for sure?

To answer the question, we should know whether we have failed because the Lord will convict us of our errors. So if we don’t happen to catch our errors, then the Lord will bring them to our attention through spiritual conviction and divine discipline, if only we heed the Spirit’s still small voice. We don’t do this perfectly, and we sin and fail many tests from the Lord -- far more than we even know. That always comes back on us. If we fail a test, it is because we knew the right thing to do and didn’t do it. We know what sin is, so if we willfully sin, then we know we have failed. However, even many lost battles and failures (inexcusable as they may be) can have the positive effect of causing us to become more serious about overcoming any future ones. 

Additionally, we must be careful not to beat ourselves up over our failures, whether we remember them or not. We do need to be deadly serious about sin, but we should never despair or condemn ourselves as unredeemable over our failures. Instead, we need to allow the Lord to be the judge while we forget what lies behind (**1 Corinthians 4:3; Philippians 3:13**). If we fail to confess some of our sins (something we all do to some extent, because none of us are perfect in our own perception), God will automatically forgive them. All that matters is that we have a repentant mindset to do better and to not continue in our bad habits.
