Below, we will examine what makes a good marriage and partner and why this is so important. God instituted marriage to keep the human population going and represent His relationship with believers that constitute His bride, the church (**Ephesians 5:25-27**). So it is not something to be taken lightly, as if one could just casually put in the efforts required to maintain it. On the contrary, it is a commitment that demands great sacrifice and continued spiritual growth. If a married man or woman’s walk with Christ begins to suffer and take a nosedive, chances are that the couple will struggle in their relationship. Next thing you know, they start thinking, speaking, and behaving toward each other as they shouldn’t. If they cannot learn how to manage their spiritual duties, then they will more likely slack off in fulfilling their rights and obligations to one another. The same principle applies to raising their children (**1 Timothy 3:5**). In this context (1 Timothy 3:5), this passage refers to pastors specifically. But we can apply this teaching to a broader group of married believers raising children. 

It is sad to see the high divorce rate in our society. Unfortunately, many Christians are struggling with this very same problem, often (though not always) due to issues they could resolve by handling it in a godly manner. However, we need to consider that it isn’t always both people’s fault. 

No, many struggles won’t go away overnight because spiritual growth is a process that takes time. So no man or woman should expect immediate results that will resolve the issue within a few days. Chances are that won’t happen. But what matters is that both partners are trying to improve in their daily walk with the Lord. All those who genuinely wish to change will do so. If there is no improvement in a person’s spiritual life, it is ALWAYS because they never wanted to change. The solution to all problems is spiritual growth. Yes, it sounds like a simple answer because it is. However, it is also true that it is easier said than done. 

It is best to conclude our question by simply stating that the quality of a man or woman’s love for God will determine how good of a partner they will be. The more they love Jesus Christ, the more love they will bestow on the partner He brings into their lives. And we can rest assured that God has the very best person in mind for all those He calls to marriage so that it will always be a perfect fit. So if a marriage is struggling or not working out, we can never blame the Lord because every good and perfect gift comes from above (**James 1:17**). His goal is to prosper, not harm us (**Jeremiah 29:11**)! People may change, but God never does! His loving care for us never fades because He is always faithful and righteous. So how can a man and a woman increasing in their faithfulness with God not improve in their relationship with one another? If we claim to be growing in Christ day by day, then any marriage should prosper, even if the path toward that goal is bumpy and uneven. Marriage, like the Christian life, is not easy. But nothing worth having in this life ever comes easy! So to receive an excellent husband or wife from the Lord means that said individuals had to have undergone the tremendous spiritual efforts involved before being united together by Christ. This does not mean reaching perfection (that isn’t possible) but that both are (in the Lord’s eyes) ready to take on their responsibilities to each other (assuming the Lord brought them together in His good time). 

And this truth leads us to state that all those ready and prepared for marriage are those who have learned to be content in their relationship with their faithful spiritual husband, our dear Lord and Savior. In other words, they need to have grown up to spiritual maturity to some extent first, not the other way around. All believers need to make God their first and foremost priority before sacrificing for another human being. If we have not learned to give things up and suffer for the Lord, we are more likely to lack in giving up many things to prosper with a marriage partner. Remember, human marriage represents our standing with our heavenly Father. Since our Lord expects us to replicate that to the best possible degree through human relationships, we must remember what kind of a testimony a good or bad marriage will give to those around us. We are ambassadors of Christ held to high standards due to the nature of our work and mission in life. So we cannot afford to take these matters lightly.

**3** Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. **4** No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him. **5** An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. **6** It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. **7** Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.

Since God tests all believers, we can be rest assured that every marriage will see its fair share of trials and tribulations. If undergoing a spiritual test, then the Lord would not have led the couple to it only to destroy their relationship. The whole point of experiencing such difficult times is to get the two individuals to rely on the Lord to increase their faith. And if both the man and woman bear up under these difficulties, their increased love for God will enlarge their love and care for one another. So to those who ask, “*How can I love my husband/wife more*?” The answer is to love God more. And serving the Lord is always a matter of choice, so this obligation is always a decision they must make. Failing to do the right thing when one can do so is not something we can blame on God because our choices always come back on us. 

But in this difficult time of the church we live in now, finding a man or woman whose love for the Lord exceeds that of the typical lukewarm attitude is extremely difficult. Those who have a higher regard for God’s Word and living it out will be the minority of Christians who truly understand their purpose and mission in life. There are very few believers in today’s church with high standards for the truth. Instead, most are indifferent and take it lightly because they don’t see it as important. But does this mean that those who do love it as they should are doomed to remain single the rest of their lives? Absolutely not! God does call some people to refrain from marriage, but many He leads to pursue it. For those He wishes to not remain by themselves, He will bring around the right person at the right time. There is nothing to worry about because God will bring the right man or woman into a believer’s life when they are ready. The person and timing are all the Lord’s choice and in His control. Do we not trust that He will bring us the very best fit? He did for Adam when He created Eve (**Genesis 2:18-25**), and so He has done for all faithful believers after that. The best thing for every young man and woman of God to do is to grow spiritually. Everyone is different, so how God brings two individuals together will vary from individual to individual, an application area requiring every believer to do what the Lord is leading them to do. “*Should I go out and start looking? Or should I hold back*? *Or should I do both*? How should I go about looking?” The Lord will make these answers clear through time spent growing in the Word. What may be unclear now will become transparent later on (**Isaiah 40:31**). 

Indeed, those who aren’t caught up in the lukewarm trends of today’s church must have higher standards for those they marry. Believers less serious about the truth will naturally gravitate toward those of lesser spiritual maturity themselves. They will, in all likelihood, share a similar mindset. But that doesn’t mean that the more faithful won’t ever find anyone just because the pickings are slimmer. They need to understand that the person the Lord brings into their life may not agree with much of what they believe at first. All that matters is that the potential spouse is serious and committed enough to change their attitude. It is the attitude of the other person that matters. All of this will occur because both need to be serious about the truth if they will prosper and not stumble over one another. Of course, that doesn’t mean a husband and wife will agree on everything because they never will. But they will share a similar zeal that will result in consistently believing the same things. And although one of them may have been wrong on many issues when they first met, they will (assuming this person was chosen for the other by God) slowly but surely begin to unravel and change their beliefs and way of thinking toward the truth. Some people will have a lot of “unlearning” to do, you might say. It is the other person’s attitude which is key. All that matters is that the potential partner is onboard with the other spiritually so that change through growth will occur.

**30** Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.

Physical attraction is definitely part of the equation when it comes to selecting a lifelong partner. However, there can be variables with this because not everyone finds their spouse or fiancée overly attractive. Let’s just say that they are attractive enough for them to want to marry them. But viewpoints will vary on whether or not one believer has to be physically attracted to the other for the relationship to work. So it is better for us not to be dogmatic here, even if most people would never date someone they didn’t find physically appealing. But although appearance does matter to some extent for most people when it comes to who they choose to marry, it is always best not to get too hung up on looks because it is the inner quality of a person that matters (**1 Peter 3:4**). The person God brings into our lives is likely someone we will be physically attracted to, so there should be no reason to worry on that end. And, of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But good outward qualities (as defined by so and so) do not guarantee that an individual is a good person who fears the Lord as they should. As **1 Samuel 16:7** shows, godliness has nothing to do with outward appearance but everything to do with the disposition of a person’s heart. And, as Proverbs 31:30 states, good looks won’t last forever because our bodies will decay and break down over time (**2 Corinthians 4:16**). But a growing faith will manifest a greater level of beauty the more it grows. 

{{% scripture p="1 Peter 3:1-6 (NIV)" %}} 

Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, **2** when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. **3** Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. **4** Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight. **5** For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, **6** like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.

The passage above reinforces our points about emphasizing the internal over the external. Wives and husbands need to ensure their behavior aligns with God’s Word instead of unnecessarily distracting themselves with physical trappings. There is nothing wrong with wanting to look good, but our number one priority is how our inner self manifests itself around others. Appearances (by themselves) won’t positively influence another because only a good heart toward God demonstrated through a godly lifestyle can make any difference in another person’s life (we are to be salt to others). 

Our passage also emphasizes the need for wives to submit to their husbands as spiritual leaders. A godly woman knows what it means to fear the Lord and shows it by properly orientating herself toward the one He has put in authority over her. Now this doesn’t make men better in any way but exists to replicate (symbolize) the spiritual relationship we the church (the bride) have with our Husband (Christ). Also, it only goes as far as marriage itself because no man not married to a certain woman has any right to exercise authority over her. Men only have leadership over women in a marriage relationship or a local church from a pastoral office. 

The book of Proverbs does not shy away from attacking the poor attitude of a wife who refuses to submit. Sometimes, there is nothing worse than a henpecker who constantly argues and patronizes their spouse. Disregarding the proper relationship a wife should have with her husband is a serious matter that challenges God’s authority because the woman refuses to accept the way God has ordained things to work. We never want to make the mistake Israel made when they challenged God by refusing to listen to Moses.

On the other hand, husbands must love their wives as their own bodies in a gentle, caring, and understanding way (**1 Peter 3:7**).

{{% scripture p="Ephesians 5:24-33 (NIV)" %}} 

**24** Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. **25** Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her **26** to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, **27** and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. **28** In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. **29** After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— **30** for we are members of his body. **31** “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” **32** This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. **33** However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

There are no few instances throughout human history of husbands physically and verbally abusing their wives, a sad reality that (although far less common) has and continues to occur in the church. The two extremes Scripture warns us against are women disrespecting their husbands' leadership through insubordination and men abusing it as an excuse to lord themselves over their spouse. We must avoid these things at all costs, something only possible through trust and obedience to Jesus Christ.
