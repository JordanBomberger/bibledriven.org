title: The Church Has Not Replaced Israel
---

Romans 11 clarifies that the church and Israel (Jews) are one and the same. Indeed, the nation of Israel began long before the time of the Gentiles consisting of the past two thousand years. But the church consists of all born again believers ever since Adam and Eve up to our present time. So the first believers were gentiles, not Jews or Israelites. But the Lord went on to choose a people that would spread His name, beginning with Abraham and his descendants. So Romans eleven isn’t stating that the Jews were the first converts, but that they were the first chosen group of people to act as ambassadors for Christ here on earth. Jesus was the rock and foundation of the church, and He was Jewish. Therefore, the church was still founded by Jews, not Gentiles. As mentioned in Romans, there is much advantage of being a Jew from Israel (**Romans 3:1-2; Romans 1:16; 2:9; 2:10**). But not all Israel is true Israel, a fact discerned by faith because only those who believe in Jesus Christ are the true “chosen ones” of God. Since God chose Israel to be the apple of His eye, how can unbelieving Israelites constitute the chosen? Only believers fall in this category.  

Romans 9:25-26 states---***25** as He also says in Hosea:“I will call those who were not My people, ‘My people,’ And her who was not beloved, ‘beloved.’” **26** “And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘you are not My people,’ There they shall be called sons of the living God.”*

The “those” referred to above consist of Gentile believers, who would become more open to the gospel message after most Jews came to reject it. This and Romans eleven tells us that Gentiles have merged with the Jews as part of the church, not separated. 

The church has nothing to do with race, genealogy, or time. Instead, it has to do with faith. By definition, a believer believes and keeps believing in the Lord Jesus Christ. So the church has always existed, even though we refer to the past two thousand years as the “church era” and “the time of the Gentiles.” Every member of God’s family has faith in common. So it doesn’t matter whether one is a Jew because rejecting the gospel means forfeiting all the blessings and advantages of Jewish heritage. Worse yet, these people will miss out on eternal life only to spend eternity away from God. But all those who put their faith and trust in God’s Son are Abraham’s spiritual seed. So what matters is the spiritual side of this, not the physical. But the Jews remain God’s physically chosen people. The ultimate promises made to Israel will see their fulfillment during and after the tribulation yet future, not before it. Therefore, Israel is a unique part of the church, not a separate category. 

Gentiles have not replaced Israel but have only joined the church, which consists of all believers. And one more thing we need to mention here is that Jews, not Gentiles, founded the church and wrote the Bible we have today. So how could it be that Jews could not be a part of something they founded and established? Jesus is a Jew, and He alone founded the church! 

The book of Ephesians solves this whole issue for us by reconciling both Jews and Gentiles un bringing them together.

**11** Therefore remember that previously you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision” *which is* performed in the flesh by human hands— **12** *remember* that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the people of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. **13** But now in Christ Jesus you who previously were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. **14** For He Himself is our peace, who made both *groups into* one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, **15** by abolishing in His flesh the hostility, *which is* the Law *composed* of commandments *expressed* in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two one new person, *in this way* establishing peace; **16** and that He might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the hostility. **17** And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near; **18** for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. **19** So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, **20** having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, **21** in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, **22** in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.

**30** What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, but the righteousness that is by faith;

The only reason we call the current period “the time of the Gentiles” is because more of them are currently coming to Christ. This trend will reverse during and after the Tribulation when Israel retakes the leading role. And there is no passage in Scripture that in any way states that Gentiles have replaced Jews or that Israel and the church exist as two separate entities. They are both the same. Israel is simply a unique part of Christ’s body of believers. 

The Greek New Testament term for “church” is *ekklesia* (ἐκκλησία) which comes from the verb “to call” and the preposition “out of.” As Dr. Luginbill of [Ichthys.com](https://www.ichthys.com) states---  

TODO

“*this is the same word used for the assembly of enfranchised citizens in the classical Greek city-states. These notions of special selection and special privilege can also be seen in the adjectival form eklektos, cognate in form and meaning with the Latin word from which our English "elect" is derived. That the Church is thus properly the universal assembly of all who choose to faithfully follow Jesus Christ during the first six millennia of human history, a chosen few (by grace through faith,* *Eph.2:8-9*), an elect group called by God out of the devil's world and into His own family, is a truth not only supported throughout the New Testament (cf.* *Matt.22:14**;* *Rom.8:33**;* *1Cor.1:27*;* *1Thes.1:4*;* *1Pet.1:1*;* *Rev.17:14*), but consistent with the picture given by the Old Testament as well, where ekklesia is the standard translation for Israel's assembly (**קהל**), the qahal.”* 

And finally, he writes,

TODO

*Central to the idea of our "election" is the purpose for it. For we who are elect are so because of Him who is **the** elect, Jesus Christ, and it is for Him that we have been chosen out of the world, to share eternity together with **the** chosen One (compare* *Is.42:1* *with 44:1; and cf.* *Lk.9:35*;* *23:35*;* *1Pet.2:4*):*
