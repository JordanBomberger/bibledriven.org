title: '"Meditation" - We are What we Think' 
weight: 500
summary: No believer can attain to spiritual maturity without first renewing their mind and learning how to keep the Lord and His truth foremost in their thoughts because we think about what we value the most, which determines our thoughts and actions. This study discusses the "thinking" aspect of the word "meditation," a synonym I use here for what goes on in our hearts/minds. That being said, this work does not seek to define the word itself.

## **Introduction**  

We have briefly discussed biblical thinking as a necessary step for spiritual growth in overcoming sin in the large topical study “Overcoming Sin- Thinking on God’s Truth.” However, although this subject is not complicated, it is such a critical and indispensable necessity for spiritual growth that a fair amount of explanation and teaching on the topic is far from out of place. In this study, we will first expound on the importance of biblical thinking and ways we can do it, followed by a non-comprehensive examination of various and prominent biblical passages that deal with the subject more specifically. However, we first need to clarify the issue involving the often confusing word “meditation.” 

## **The Word “Meditation**" 

Firstly, the word meditation has different meanings (some examples from the Old Testament involve murmuring words to oneself out loud in multiple ways) for different people. “Meditation” (and this is the way we will use it for the remainder of this study since that is how many believers understand the word’s biblical meaning, which makes using it all that more convenient) can be what we are describing here as thinking and reflecting on God’s truth (all of it as contained in Scripture), mulling over it, chewing on it, dwelling on and preoccupying ourselves with it. There is no cookie-cutter way to do this specifically (thinking quietly to ourselves versus expressing our thoughts out loud), and we can describe the process in multiple ways as long as they all mean the same thing. The topic of this study is just that: thinking on or “setting our minds” on the truths of God’s Word to better please and glorify Him through spiritual growth (things above **Colossians 3:2** and see **Philippians 4:8**). Therefore, the goal is **not to define meditation** since it can have multiple meanings (within and without the body of Christ), but we will use the word here as a synonym since the word itself and the common meaning given to it within the church are what many believers are familiar with. This study specifically hones in on the “thinking” aspect of meditation (what goes on in our hearts/minds). 

On the other hand, we will not (for obvious reasons) exert ourselves with directly confronting and refuting many of the false and unbiblical forms, methods, and types of “meditation” (such as contemplative prayer and some of what we see promoted in the medical field and many false religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism as but only two examples) because we need not care about what others wrongly think of the matter. Ultimately, our only concern should be the truth of what the Bible says when subjecting our thinking to Christ and His Word. 

## **Meditation is all About What Goes on in our Hearts**  

There is no specific way to mediate (also known as “virtue thinking”- credits to **Dr. Luginbill** for that phrase) because how (see below) we do it (much like how we have our quiet times) is not as important as that we do it. The Bible gives no rules on thinking about the truth because that isn’t the issue, as we’ve just seen. Most importantly, it is all about what goes on in our hearts, which means the content or subject matter involves our Lord Jesus and all the truth He has revealed through His Word. We can (as two “how” examples) ponder the truth quietly to ourselves or do so vocally out loud in prayer (or not). We can meditate on verses we’ve studied to understand their interpretation or contemplate their meaning after we’ve understood them. We can even think about Christ and His truth while we pray to the extent that we can or while reading His Word (a pretty obvious one there). It is also a good practice to count our blessings, remember all the great and wonderful things the Lord has done for us in times past, and look forward to our eternal glorious future with Him in eternity. 

The point is that time, location, “methods,” and circumstances generally don’t matter. True, there are periods when we must focus on other things, such as operating a forklift or carrying out our duties at work, etc. Undoubtedly, there are times when meditation is not only not practical or possible but can also be dangerous when our minds need to be wholly set on the task at hand (whatever it is we may be doing, depending on how preoccupied we are with other things). The best approach (or one we should all strive for) is to reflect on Christ (including everything He has done and is doing) and His Word whenever possible. If we can’t, we can’t, but if we can, we should. Do we meditate all the time, even when we can? No, because it is fair to say no one does, and there is nothing wrong or sinful about that (just as there is nothing sinful about not reading our Bibles every day). Nevertheless, we should strive to engage our minds with the truth as much as is convenient because what goes on in our hearts determines what we think, say, and do. 

The point above brings to our attention a common suggestion many believers give to others when discussing this subject: to set aside a specific time during the day to partake in this spiritual activity. It is true that how we do it doesn’t matter because some meditation is better than none. However, for safety's sake, it isn’t something we should limit to a particular period in the day (such as during our quiet times) because, as mentioned, we should motivate ourselves to pursue it throughout the day as the opportunities present themselves because what we think determines our behavior. And, of course, we should never view it as some chore but as a pleasurable, meaningful, and purposeful activity we embrace with a willing heart. 

Also, reflecting on God’s truth is more than mere aimless and pointless contemplation of facts because we think about what we believe, care for, and value the most. The truth has a purpose and means something to us as things we have believed (and if we don’t understand something, we keep studying and thinking about it until we do). It involves internalizing the spiritual virtues we have learned (or are learning) so that they affect our outlook on life which in turn transforms our behavior. It is something we do that helps to strengthen our faith, hope, and love (**1 Thessalonians 1:3**). All three of these aspects (meditation included) are only possible through the Spirit’s power so that we have to have surrendered our hearts/minds over to Him beforehand (**Galatians 5:16-25**). The Holy Spirit must always be involved because we need His leading to guide our minds in the direction He wants them to go, which is very analogous to how He intercedes on our behalf because we don’t always know what to pray (**Romans 8:26-28**). 

The takeaway is that meditation is a sign that we are walking in the Spirit because we have chosen to align our thinking to His (we have surrendered our hearts/minds over to Him). The Bible expresses God’s purposes and plans for the believer and lays out all the requirements and instructions on how to carry them out so that whenever we calibrate our thinking to His Word, we have chosen to think as He would have us. Our next section below will delve into these critical points in more detail. 

## **Why Meditation is Necessary and Important- Pertinent Passages**  

Meditation cannot occur unless we first (assuming the individual falls into either of the two categories in parenthesis)  repent (from sin or unbelief-whichever) and seek the truth. After that, “virtue thinking” and spiritual growth should co-occur. A reasonable analogy pertinent to our subject is cooking a good stew or soup. First, we must “add the ingredients” by taking in the Word through diligent Bible study and good sound teaching, followed by “stirring all the ingredients together” (thinking about what we’ve learned to understand and believe it) by meditating on the truth to “serve up the food” through application (we are told in **1 Peter 5:8-9** to be **alert** and of **sober mind** to resist temptation by applying the truth). And we would be remiss not to mention that the heart and mind, in this case, are thus used to describe the same thing as two sides of the same coin. So when we say the battle starts in the heart, we also refer to the mind and vice versa since the heart (the interface between the body and spirit where they both interact) is the place of our volition, emotions, values, etc.  As for why “biblical thinking” is so critical, we will examine a non-comprehensive list of applicable passages below. 

### **1 Peter 5:8-9**  

{{% scripture p="1 Peter 5:8-9 (NIV)" %}} 

**8** Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. **9** Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.

The passage above (as with some of the others we reference below) does not expressly or directly mention meditation (s process intertwined with spiritual growth) or thinking on things above but is the primary way we keep our thoughts pure and braced for spiritual combat. We cannot allow our minds to wander by sucking up impure thoughts because the moment we do is the instant we let our guard down, which makes us vulnerable to spiritual attack. The believer keeps an alert and sober mind by concentrating on goldy things, biblical truths, principles, and virtues (we will discuss this later). As already mentioned, meditation is a sign that we have given our hearts over to the Lord and are, therefore, under His control so that we are walking in the Spirit (if you walk by the Spirit you will not give into the lusts of the flesh **Galatians 6:16**). To have one’s mind set on things above is synonymous with having our heart where it should be since the mind is a facet of the heart. If one is in the right place, the other will naturally be so as well. 

{{% scripture p="Colossians 3:1-10 (NKJV)" %}} 

**1** If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. **2** Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. **3** For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. **4** When Christ *who is* our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.  

{{% /scripture %}}  

If we have set our thoughts on heavenly things, we think clearly, and our chances of withstanding any spiritual attack increase drastically. True, we still have to choose to resist all temptations in the Spirit’s power (it is still possible to disobey when confronted with temptation while meditating), but having the truth ready at hand fresh in our minds allows the Spirit to more easily “work with us” in helping us to win the victory. The point is that we are less likely to give in when our thoughts are aligned with the truth, as opposed to if we were thinking about negative things. It is not a sin to be tempted or even to have bad thoughts alone, but they cannot stay there and must be dealt with as quickly as possible because dallying almost always leads to failure. 

To sum up **1 Peter 5:8-9**, having an “alert” and “sober” mind requires prior, present, and continuous spiritual growth, a process achieved with the help of thinking on things above (meditating). Having our minds fastened to the truth increases our hope, strengthens our faith, and grows our love for God and everyone else. The more we think positively, the more naturally these three virtues increase, resulting in more spiritual growth, advancement, and spiritual fruit. With that, we will move on to our next passages.

### **1 Peter 1:13 and Colossians 3:1-4** 

{{% scripture p="1 Peter 1:13 (NIV)" %}} 

**13** Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming.                                   

{{% /scripture %}}   

{{% scripture p="Colossians 3:1-4 (NKJV)" %}} 

**1**If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. **2** Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. **3** For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. **4** When Christ *who is* our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.

The state of soberness described in **1 Peter 1:13** means not being "spiritually drunk" with our thoughts and minds totally out of control and all over the place. In other words, our mind/heart and spirit are in a calm, tranquil state (**Psalm 131:1-2**), unhindered, undistracted, and undeterred by any inside or outside force because they are squarely focused on the comforting hopes derived from the pure milk of the Word (the meaning of alertness above). That is to say, we have an undivided heart (**Psalm 86:11**) and are not double-minded and unstable in our ways (**James 1:6-8**). Trying to live the Christian life with a divided mind only leads to failure, resulting in instability and inconsistency. 

{{% scripture p="James 1:6-8 (NIV)" %}} 

**6** But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. **7** That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. **8** Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.                                                                          

{{% /scripture %}}     

The immediate context of **James 1:6-8** involves praying in faith instead of doubt because prayer always requires faith. However, we can apply this passage to our present subject because we cannot have a split mind regarding our thoughts. The things we dwell on in our hearts will dictate how we think, speak, and act so that, just as is the case with the food we eat (you are what you eat), **we are what we think**. Does that mean words and actions cannot be deceptive? They most certainly can, as has been the case with many “actors” or “hypocrites” throughout history (the Scribes and Pharisees in our Lord’s day before and after (**Matthew 23:27**). Admittedly, we are all sinners and guilty of this sin to some extent.  However, a person’s true colors will leak through in one way or another to demonstrate that their general behavior is nothing but a facade. Ultimately, thoughts reflect an individual's beliefs and values so that they dwell on what matters to them most (the heart contains our volition and values). However, we should note that meditation (by itself) is not the application of truth but a prerequisite to applying what we know.  

{{% scripture p="Proverbs 23:6-8 (NASB 1995)" %}} 

Do not eat the bread of a selfish person; Or desire his delicacies; **7 For as he thinks within himself, so he is**. He says to you, “Eat and drink!” But his heart is not with you.**8** You will vomit up the morsel you have eaten And waste your compliments. 

{{% /scripture %}}      

To resume our point, we cannot expect to please the Lord when our minds are constantly set on things below instead of things above (**Colossians 3:2-4**) because the end product of fleshly thinking results in all manner of sinful behaviors (**Romans 8:5**). In other words, we cannot have the alert and sober mind needed to resist temptation and properly endure through any trials and tribulations we may currently face. If we want to worship the Lord in **Spirit** and **truth** (**John 4:24**), we must be under the Spirit’s control, something we couldn’t do without surrendering our hearts and minds to Him. We cannot be double-minded in our thinking because it is impossible to please and serve the Lord as we should when our minds are on other things. If we genuinely value the Lord and His truth more than anything else, we would much rather spend more time thinking about those things instead of all the worries, concerns, cares, desires, and lusts of this life. So is the sad state of affairs in the present lukewarm era of Laodicea we presently live in today **Revelation 3:14-22** (the thorny soil in our passage below) who treasure and esteem more the world and its offerings over the Lord Jesus Christ and the treasures of His Word. 

{{% scripture p="Matthew 13:18-23 (NIV)" %}} 

**18** “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: **19** When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. **20** The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. **21** But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. **22** The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the **worries of this life** and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. **23** But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”                                                   

{{% /scripture %}}     

We need to say a brief word on the " heart " issue because of the troubling and unbiblical teaching that tells us to follow and trust in it. By itself (absent faith, truth, and the Holy Spirit), this aspect of our human makeup is entirely evil and something we must calibrate to the Holy Spirit and His truth to keep it in line. That is to say, we can choose to use the heart for good or evil (either for the flesh and the Devil or God). Therefore, the heart needs good “spiritual nutrition” utilized by the Holy Spirit to obey Christ. We guard our hearts by taking in the truth and applying it (a process known as spiritual growth). Scripture describes the believer as a slave of Christ, something not possible unless we have willfully submitted to the Lord with all our hearts. There is a huge reason why the greatest commandment in Scripture is to love the Lord our God with all our **heart**: the absolute surrender of it is the only way we can serve and follow the Lord as we should. We must be ever willing to deny ourselves, pick up our crosses, and follow after Christ day by day and moment by moment, a process that requires us to surrender our thoughts to Christ and His Word (something we choose to do that results in obedience). As believers, we have the armor of God at our disposal to wage war against all spiritual threats (**Ephesians 6:10-18**). 

{{% scripture p="Psalm 119:1-11 (ESV)" %}} 

**9**How can a young man keep his way pure? **By guarding it according to your word**.**10** With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! **11 I have stored up your word in my heart,** **that I might not sin against you**.

{{% /scripture %}}        

With the above said, we will now continue our examination of **1 Peter 1:13** (we have already thoroughly addressed the overall gist of **Colossians 3:2**). Our Peter passage tells us to set our hope on the grace to be fully realized at Christ’s second advent return. This eschatological event includes our resurrection (where we receive our perfect new bodies without sin and void of any possibility of death) and the Bema seat of Christ, where we receive our eternal rewards. Our hope rests in the absolute realization that we will live with Christ forever in perfect bliss, with all the blessings we receive accrued through spiritual service during our time here on earth. Once again, meditation is a necessary part of spiritual growth as an intertwining step. Included in this essential spiritual activity is replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. 

As some examples, it is not good to worry or be anxious all the time (sometimes manifested through complaining) because we know that God will supply all our spiritual, mental, and physical needs in ways that He determines and as He sees fit **Philippians 4:19** (we know that **all things** work together for good for those who love God **Romans 8:28**). No, this doesn’t mean we have to like any of our present strenuous circumstances. But by continuously keeping those two passages in mind and remembering that all of the difficulties and sufferings in this life will result in an eternal weight of glory (**2 Corinthians 4:17-18**), we set ourselves up for true success while handling our situations as we should. This truth is something the grumbling, rebellious exodus generation would have done well to keep in mind (**1 Corinthians 10:1-13**), and it is a good lesson that we, the present-day lukewarm church, need always to remember. Most believers today are unwilling to face the sufferings involved with spiritual growth through trials, tribulations, and satanic opposition because it is uncomfortable and entails sacrificing things they have placed far above their proper place. But this is the only way to advance anywhere spiritually (**Acts 14:22**).  

We cannot allow the worries and difficulties of this life to distract our minds from their proper focus because doing so will only lead to mishandling of life circumstances meant to better our faith by strengthening and refining it. Yes, there are many distractions in this life, and constantly remaining mentally and spiritually vigilant is no easy task in a world that presents more “diversions” than ever. But it is not good to worry or constantly complain (we should strive never to do so even though none of us is perfect on this score). Instead, it is always best to trust and hope in the Lord by allowing Him to fill our hearts with peace and reassurance, good qualities we can only have with minds squarely fixed on Him and the hope-filled promises of His Word (including the guarantees of eternal life and all the eternal rewards to come with it meant to encourage and motivate us to give our very best). Fear and worry paralyze faith, while complaining is a negative manifestation of discontent (sometimes fear) stemming from an ungrateful and unbelieving heart. 

{{% scripture p="Isaiah 26:3 (ESV)" %}} 

You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.

**25** “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? **26** Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? **27** Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life? **28** “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. **29** Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. **30** If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? **31** So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ **32** For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. **33** But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. **34** Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.                                                               

{{% /scripture %}}       

So, when faced with difficulties (temptations, rough, trying, or irritating circumstances and situations, etc.), the best thing for believers to do is to distract themselves with good and encouraging realities that promise deliverance and better things, not only in this life but in the one to come (this leads to our following passage below). It is also a good practice to count our blessings and “name them one by one” because it helps us to remember all that God has given and done for us. This good habit increases our faith and encourages us to keep persevering because we recognize that hardship and personal loss in this world will never be able to take away all the good we have received from Christ in the past, all the good we have and receive now, and the ultimate prize and blessing we will inherit in the new heaven and earth. Meditation helps us to remember that this world is not our home (all trials and difficulties will eventually end since nothing lasts forever) and that we are sojourners in enemy territory not our own (**1 Peter 2:11**), keeping our perspective and perception aligned with the clear reality of the truth. Negotiating this world as the Lord would have us requires that we see things as they are, through the lens of faith in the truth, constantly cherished, believed in our hearts, and applied. Spiritual combat is a twenty-four-seven business that demands our hearts and minds be focused and “loaded with truth” at all times, not just during challenging periods. 

To conclude, we must think positively because God wants us to be happy and joyful people who live like they truly do possess hope, purpose, and meaning in this life. As stated earlier, we are what we think, so our thoughts will often reflect in our conduct. We may not always be in the best of moods (feelings and emotions alone are not sinful). Still, we can control how we react to how we feel by channeling our thoughts and emotions into godly things (we control how we respond to our thoughts and feelings), something only possible if our hearts, thoughts, and attitudes (all synonyms to describe the same thing) are in the right place. Biblical meditation is a sign that we are in tune with the Spirit. It is also a helpful and preventative guard against acting on the inclinations of our sinful nature (also known as the flesh).

### **Romans 12:1-2 and Romans 8:5-7** 

{{% scripture p="Romans 12:1-2 (ESV)" %}} 

I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. **2** Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.                                                                       

{{% /scripture %}}  

In **Romans 12:1-2**, Paul urges his believing audience/readers to honor the Lord with their bodies by keeping them from sinful behavior. We worship the Lord by keeping His commandments and living for Him **John 14:15**. Verse one mentions the word “mercy” and, along with God’s grace and kindness, is meant to help spur us on for Him **Romans 2:4**. **Romans 6:13 says**, “*Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness*." The only way to carry this out is to renew the mind, a process accomplished by seeking the truth, understanding it, believing it, thinking about it, and applying it. In other words, a complete change of mind/heart/attitude that leads to a change of behavior or lifestyle (also known as repentance) is first needed for any spiritual growth. Now, Paul’s readers were already believers, so this command to them specifically would be more like “Keep offering yourselves to the Lord in the same way you’ve already been doing. If you are caught up in sinful behavior, stop doing it and adjust your thinking to overcome it.” That is to say, those who are already doing what this verse prescribes need to keep doing it, striving to be more aggressive in the process with each passing day. On the other hand, those slacking brothers and sisters needed to double down on their spiritual growth and “get cracking.”  

Renewing our minds means aligning our hearts/minds/thoughts to the truth (and acting on it) as opposed to the lusts and desires of this world. It means to change how we think so that our thoughts, words, and actions follow suit (we are what we think!). **Romans 8:5-7** more directly addresses this subject.  

{{% scripture p="Romans 8:5-7 (NKJV)" %}} 

**5** For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those *who live* according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. **6** For to be carnally minded *is* death, but to be spiritually minded *is* life and peace. **7** Because the carnal mind *is* enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. 

{{% /scripture %}}   

The context in the passage above contrasts believers and unbelievers (the state of belief vs unbelief) but can also apply to believers walking in the flesh as opposed to the Spirit and vice versa. Believers are those who live according to the Spirit. However, this is something no one does perfectly because we all have sinful natures (our flesh) that still desire to do wrong. There are plenty of times when we all sin because we refuse to yield ourselves to the Spirit’s influence. Anytime we transgress it is because we momentarily set our mind on something evil. And if that sin is rampant in our lives, then we haven’t made it a habit to guard our hearts (engaging in the battle for the high ground of our hearts). The things we set our minds on determine the direction we will go.

**8** Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. **9** What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

The passage above is well known and often brought up when discussing the subject of meditation, and for good reason. As mentioned earlier in our illustration of adding and mixing the ingredients in the pot (thinking/dwelling on God’s truth), we “stir” the ingredients to “serve” them (applying the truth we love and cherish in our hearts). Verse nine confirms this principle by reminding us that we first need to learn the truth and then believe it to apply it through faith. We will examine these spiritual qualities Paul lists in verse eight one at a time. 

#### **A. True** 

The Greek word for “true” is ἀληθής alēthēs and refers to whatever is true “according to the facts” instead of lies and falsehood (a pretty self-explanatory word). The Bible is the sole source of this truth (**2 Timothy 3:16-17**), and we are the “miners” who must dig into it thoroughly (**2 Timothy 2:15**) to properly understand and utilize this most precious of spiritual resources (a process accomplished through reading/studying the Word on our own and availing ourselves to sound Bible teaching). Like the fruits of the Spirit mentioned in **Galatians 5:22-23**, all the other critical spiritual virtues discussed here in our passage have one primary virtue that summarizes the rest. In our Galatians passage, love was the leading fruit from which all the others stemmed (the first and greatest commandment that sums up the Law and the prophets **Matthew 22:37-40** and the greatest of all spiritual virtues **1 Corinthians 13:13**). Likewise, truth is the first and greatest virtue in our present context. 

What could we consider just, commendable, pure, etc., if the truth were relative? If relativism in any form were true (it clearly isn’t), then all the other good things on our list would be a matter of simple opinion. Nothing could be known, and there would be no assurance of anything, so much so that the dangers of such unbiblical thinking are apparent (there are way too many to delve into here, so giving a comprehensive list would be impossible). The world would be a much more confusing, chaotic, and dangerous place that flies in the face of God’s intended order of things because He is not the author of confusion (**1 Corinthians 14:33**). 

On the contrary, it is man, encouraged and empowered by the Devil, who twists and confuses the truth to lead people astray (**Romans 1:18**). Yet we know that God’s existence is apparent (**Romans 1:19-20**) and that all we need to know about Him after salvation can and must be learned through the truths of His Word properly applied (experience is a great teacher). Some unbelievers seek purpose and meaning through worldly success and materialism. In contrast, others believe we have no purpose and meaning since nothing can be truly known (the exact conclusion absolute relativism leads to). Yet, we do have purpose and meaning (despite what some say) found only in Jesus Christ (despite what the unbelieving world wants to believe). 

Therefore, the truths of God’s Word are the very “truth” our passage has in mind (even though the canon of Scripture was not yet complete when Paul penned these words). When we believe them, they affect our outlook on life and many of the choices we make from thereon. If we know something to be true, we believe it because our Lord’s words are pure and cannot lie (we accept all of it with absolute certainty and without reservations once we’ve understood it). The truth teaches us how to live, speak, and act (to say no to ungodliness) and, therefore, can transform us by changing our lives for the better (true transformation begins inwardly and then expresses itself outwardly). 

Therefore, if truth were relative, it would be impossible to live the Christian life. Indeed, we see the damage wrought by this extreme attitude outside the church. Yet, there is a more subtle form(s) that has crept almost unawares into the body of Christ (our present lukewarm church era known as Laodicea (**Revelation 3:14-22**). 

On the one hand, and opposite of the relativists, you have many rigid, cultic, and legalistic church groups and denominations out there (both saved and unsaved) that believe they hold a monopoly on the truth despite being wrong on so many important issues. However, we know that no one person or group has all the answers (no one is right about everything) and that consistently discovering the truth involves seeking it out with the right disposition of heart (it has nothing to do with any group or denominational affiliations). Unfortunately, many out there have a lot of zeal without knowledge (**Proverbs 19:2** and **Romans 10:1-4** regarding Israel and her zealous but legalistic leaders). As the old saying goes, “The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.”

However, just because the above groups have their own issues does not make those who hold to the other extreme correct. We will discuss it here, right below. So what is this complacent relativism that has swept through the church for so much of her history (especially the past 140 years or so)? To me, there appear to be two forms of it. 

**The first** involves apostates and backsliding Christians (those weak in their faith, assuming they have any left) and refers to this idea that there is much in Scripture that we cannot and should not attempt to know despite the Bible stating it directly or indirectly (depends on the particular person).These would be people who doubt the basic tenets of the faith. This thinking has led to many apostate unbelievers who have exchanged the truth for the lie and have supplemented their faith for worthless substitutes (absolute relativism and Atheism are only two of many examples). Granted, there may be some things they believe and teach that agree with Scripture (having a form of godliness), but they do so while denying its true power since they cannot apply the truth without faith in Jesus Christ (see **2 Timothy 3:1-9** and **1 Corinthians 2:13-15**). It is fair to say that many well-meaning biblical scholars who started well have turned into liberal apostates and remained in their professions only to dismantle the church “from within” by attempting to destroy the truth needed for it to thrive and survive. Despite their best efforts, God and His truth remain the same and unchanged for eternity (**Hebrews 13:8**), even if these men and women have managed to drag some followers with them.

In all fairness, it isn’t just liberal, unbelieving scholars who are the problem but any believer not firmly grounded in the truth **through faith** susceptible to apostasy resulting from the distortion of one, a few, or many critical truths (whatever they may be). Backsliding always starts somewhere because even the smallest seed(s) of doubt left unopposed can lead to worsening damage and devasting results over time. If we become too lenient in our thinking by reasoning that what we believe doesn’t matter (anyone’s view could be correct and that we don’t have to have views on much at all), then (depending on the teaching, principle, or doctrine we are ignoring or doubting), we risk the damage and even the shipwreck of our faith (**1 Timothy 1:18-20**). It has been far from an uncommon occurrence from skeptics within and without the body of Christ (unbelievers or believers “on skids”) to challenge the validity of just one particular doctrine, teaching, or part of the Bible that has led to their rejection of all of it. Some have reasoned that certain essential teachings (crucial to the faith, whatever they may be) cannot be known and that any other could be correct (or they find some seeming contradiction they think exposes the Bible), so why bother with Christianity anymore (better yet, why not actively oppose the truth and drag others with us)? This attitude stems from a lack of hope and trust in the Lord and His ability to work things out.

None of this is to say that we can know as much as we may wish in Scripture. In other words, not every verse in the Bible gives us every detail we desire to know, and there are some questions we may have that we won’t know the answers to until we reach eternity. Nevertheless, what we have in God’s Word provides us with all the information we need and is sufficient for that reason. 

The above leads us to wonder if there are things we can’t be dogmatic about. The answer to this question is a simple yes; there are some things in Scripture we can’t be dogmatic about (there is a chance we could be wrong on some of the interpretations we make). That is because we are fallible human beings prone to error, and no one gets everything right. Another reason is that some passages in the Bible do not give us direct statements, and we have to make interpretations based on either implied, indirect evidence (based on the context or language) or no evidence at all (so that it comes down to, which way do you take this verse?). All of this is to say that there is a difference between a clear and direct interpretation and one based on implied and indirect evidence. 

Technically, everything we believe in the Bible (including things we teach and argue for dogmatically) is an interpretation since we still have to work not only with the passage in question but also show how other verses scattered throughout fit together in agreement (Scripture usually reinforces itself like building blocks). There are many verses/teachings in Scripture we can be dogmatic about (the Trinity, gospel, and deity of Christ as but only a tiny handful of obvious examples) because they are stated directly and clearly in many of the places they show up so that there really is no way of getting around the clear and obvious answer (other than to add to, take away, or twist the text). 

So what about stuff in the Bible (whatever those things may be) where we don’t have enough information to be “dogmatic” but still expected to understand the meaning and believe it? We need to remember that everything we have in Scripture is there for a reason and is generally meant to be understood and believed. So even though we cannot be dogmatic about everything in that we categorize it as “doctrine,” that does not mean that the more “vague” verses and passages (usually involving smaller issues) shouldn’t be understood, believed, and taught because it is the pastor teacher’s job to do just that, believe and teach God’s Word! This point also implies that all laymen (non-teachers) need to (after seeking it out and studying it for quite some time with the help of their pastor), sooner or later, come to accept correct interpretations of general biblical truths by taking positions (no matter how long it takes; as long as we are trying, that is all that matters even if we won’t know the answers to everything this side of eternity) instead of a **general attitude** of lingering “in-between” out of a lukewarm indifference toward it **Revelation 3:14-22**- (we won’t have the answers to everything but it is the attitude toward the truth in general which we are criticizing here). The reason for that is simple enough because truth that is not understood and believed does nobody any good and won’t result in any spiritual growth at all (it also discourages others from “seeking” and “finding” the answers to grow thereby **Matthew 7:7**). So even if we aren’t dogmatic about something, that doesn’t mean we cannot believe and teach it with absolute certainty because I see no contradiction between those statements. If we teach something to others, we must believe it with absolute certainty because if we don’t, then we have no business sharing it until we are confident we have fully understood and accepted it ourselves.

True comprehension and belief are prerequisites to becoming “doers of the Word” and not just “hearers” (**James 1:22-25**). But we may ask, “Why is it often so difficult to understand the Bible, and why doesn’t Scripture just come out and state everything else plainly like it does other things?” The answer is that it is meant to be a test of our faith to demonstrate just how much we REALLY DO want the truth, and this is where so many Christians are failing today (hence, we have so many caught up in Atheism). The parables Jesus spoke to His Jewish countrymen during His time on earth were not meant to keep people from the truth but were (in addition to other reasons) presented in such a way to confirm Israel’s unbelief. If the people wanted to know the truth, they could have asked for deeper clarity and explanation (only Jesus’s disciples and those genuinely interested in His message and not just His miracles wanted to know the answers). Unfortunately, the sad state of the church today involves many believers demonstrating a lack of love and interest for the truth (in general), particularly in the form of good, solid Bible teaching (**2 Timothy 4:1-7**).  If everything were easy, our faith would have far fewer opportunities to demonstrate itself in action and grow. Therefore, we do have to study, pray, and do our due diligence as “unashamed workmen rightly dividing the word of truth.”

Admittedly, it can be frustrating when dealing with a complex matter involving the truth that the Bible doesn’t state directly (we have all had our experiences with those scenarios). However, the difficulties we face help to build Christian character, which better qualifies us to help others in the future (something we couldn’t do in ministry unless we experienced it ourselves). If we ask and seek, we will find the answer if we want it (whether that takes days, weeks, months, or even years). Many things do not always come to us quickly (we often have a lot of things to unlearn and grow out of), and we would do well to consider that just because we desire something now doesn’t mean we are ready for it. The answer(s) may not come to us until we have grown to a point where we can better handle them. And how do we increase our faith to be ready for those particular answers we may seek (whatever they may be)? We accomplish this growth by aggressively pursuing the truth, not just throwing up our hands and giving up (which can cause us to succumb to false teaching). This point leads to our next one. 

**The second** “type” or “shade” of relativism (perhaps borderline relativism in this case) I see in the church (a less serious but still dangerous form) tends to involve many believers in general, not so much those flirting with apostasy (not backsliding believers and unbelieving skeptics, which differentiates the two degrees of “relativism” we are describing here) but who are, by all appearances, strong in their faith in God so that it isn’t dangling by a thread (they accept the foundational principles of the faith necessary to be saved). 

This attitude of complacency leads to a general relativistic-like mentality of “You believe this, and I believe that, but in the end, what does it matter? We just need to be unified and love one another because those things aren't that important and either one of us could be wrong (a phrase often used as a “feel good” excuse to alleviate the stinging consequences of indifference where those who state such things don’t understand the true meaning of biblical love and unity). Or the reasoning goes something like “We’ll find out in eternity.” That statement is sometimes true (there are plenty of things we don’t and can’t know about this side of Heaven), but it gets applied too much. It depends on the subject under discussion. Disagreements will always exist (no two people will ever agree on everything), but it is more the amount and type of things people disagree on that are the issue (the **general attitude** of the people involved). 

The point is that if something is in the Bible, it is meant to be sought out and understood (even if we all get things wrong). So, although on the one hand, there is the one extreme of going beyond what is written by teaching things that don't appear anywhere in Scripture, there is also the other extreme of being too “hand-wavy” on things we can know that the Bible contains (eschatology being a considerable example) by wagging our fingers at those who rightfully seek to understand the matter(s) under discussion (whatever they may be). So, although we are all (myself included) guilty of erring on both sides, we should do our best to suppress the urge to do either when doing so is not appropriate. 

The above in the last two paragraphs is far from an uncommon attitude for many believers toward biblical truth. Eschatology is an excellent example and not coincidental because the book of Revelation and all the other biblical passages about the end times are more important and applicable to us today than at any other time in the church’s history. Never has the truth about the tribulation (please understand that this is just one out of other examples) been more critical for believers than now because we are closer to that period than all the generations who came before us. So it is not surprising that Satan has been aggressively opposing the church to thwart their understanding of these matters ("we don't need to know much about the end times because those things aren't that applicable to us") because they are exceptionally important to understand and believe, so much so that (depending on what we are discussing) getting certain things wrong (such as believing in this false idea of a pre-tribulation rapture as but only one example) may cause a person to stumble depending on how much of an effect they allowed it to have on their faith and walk with Christ. It is often the case that (to various degrees) we are what we believe, so that what we choose to accept tends to alter (either for good or for the better) our faith.  

It is no surprise to see the body of Christ engaging in the game of “fifty-two pick- up” where many are encouraged to believe that what they accept doesn’t matter "as long as we are unified" because Satan is the father of lies (**John 8:44**) who wishes to throw Christ’s followers into confusion by making it extremely difficult to pursue and discover the truth. That is not how things should be because God is not the author of confusion but of peace through the Holy Spirit (**1 Corinthians 14:33**). Truth not understood, accepted, and believed can’t benefit us if we don’t care to have it. There is only one correct answer on any given matter, so it is unacceptable (especially regarding weightier biblical matters and subjects) to adopt a compromising attitude of justifying and condoning this mentality of being too lenient with the Bible. And, depending on what we falsely believe, getting certain things wrong can negatively impact our faith. All of this makes it even more unacceptable to claim we are spiritually OK when in reality, we are not. Our Lord’s evaluation of us confirms that the general church isn’t quite what they think they are. We need to take the Lord’s wise counsel to heart and “purchase eye salve” from Him for our eyes so that we can see our true spiritual condition. But, as it is (even as true born-again believers, unlike the Pharisees), the fact that we say we see shows that our guilt remains.

In all fairness, there are many things most believers agree on where “not getting the matter right” understandably raises red flags for those involved. So, it is not as if there is no interest in anything among most Christians in most congregations (obviously). However, there are far too many doctrines, teachings, and issues that believers are either just flat-out wrong on (because of over-rigidly putting tradition over the truth) or are too “relaxed” and “laid back” over. Both extremes often lead to believing lies and exposure to false teaching. 

No one gets everything right or comes close to knowing everything. But to do the best for the Lord, we need to give **our best** for Him in that we zealously seek the truth with all our hearts without compromise (**a process that requires us to get out of our comfort zones**!). It is unacceptable to provide only half our efforts! True, there are plenty of smaller issues in Scripture where getting them wrong is more forgivable and not a big deal (of course!). However, we cannot allow apathy to characterize our **general approach** to the Christian life! We need to do our best to learn the whole counsel of God, not just the things that comfort or spark our interest the most (such as many of the encouraging and uplifting verses we have, especially in Psalms). So before we move on to the next word in our passage (whatever is honorable **Philippians 4:8**), we need to briefly examine **2 Timothy 3:16**.

{{% scripture p="Acts 20:25-27 (ESV)" %}}

The phrase, “*All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,*” above shows us that the Bible (all 66 books we have today, even though the New Testament wasn’t yet complete when Paul penned this verse) is the very mind of Christ (we need it to know better, understand, and grow closer to Him). Therefore, since He is the author and His words originate with Him, we would do well to pay it our utmost respect and attention. We should strive to seek out, understand, and think about (consider) all the Bible has to offer, not just the parts we like, while ignoring the ones we may prefer less because they make us uncomfortable. Indeed, even controversial things have only one answer, and the only thing stopping us from getting them right is ourselves (Satan loves to use multiple opinions and views to muddy the waters to intimidate, discourage, and confuse the well-meaning believer from discovering the truth). There tends to be a “fear of the unknown” when many people approach Scripture because they were preconditioned to believe certain things they are afraid to let go due to a greater desire to put tradition, passion, and comfort before the truth. However, the answers will come if we are willing to endure whatever we must to get them (getting the truth will often require us to get out of our comfort zones), which may require a significant period (however long) of testing, testing, and more testing (**Acts 17:11**). There is no guarantee this will be easy because"truth seeking" can be a difficult and painful process that may require a considerable amount of time and patience. However, just because it can be hard does not mean we shouldn't try! And when we try, we do so to get what we are after no matter how long it takes (as if running a race to win!).

#### **Doctrine**

Next are the necessary benefits we must reap from Scripture, the first being doctrine. The word refers to biblical teachings in general. Examples of biblical doctrine include but are not limited to, the gospel (including the Trinity and deity of Christ), eschatology/prophecy, baptism, creation, spiritual gifts, church polity, conditional security, etc. There are many doctrines in the Bible, but suffice it to say that we have provided only a few examples. The word doctrine refers to the general teachings in God’s Word, some of the more important ones we have just mentioned. 

It is true that getting some of the above teachings wrong doesn’t eliminate salvation (if we exclude the gospel, Trinity, and deity of Christ from our non-comprehensive list) but can (depending on the severity) threaten it by damaging faith. The reader should be familiar with my take (including the dangers of getting them wrong) on the issue of conditional security (faith must remain till death because if it doesn’t, salvation will be lost because only believers are saved), the timing of the tribulation (there is no pre-tribulation rapture), young earth creationism (the Bible does teach a gap between **Genesis 1:1-2**), and the “sign gifts” (they have been discontinued) as but only a few of the more prominent examples. However, simply waving the hand and saying, “We can disagree on those things,” is not a good approach because it encourages relativism (an attitude that has been destroying the church) by creating complacency that has much bearing on the believer's spiritual growth and safety. In other words, these are not small teachings (all Scripture is important, but some are more critical to the faith than others). Getting anything wrong is never good, but some things are more of a big deal. 

Getting certain other things wrong (some examples just provided above) will cause way more damage, which is the point (of all things to get incorrect, we would hope they would be less consequential issues). We are all free to disagree on these things, but should we settle for that? The answer is no. Are there severe dangers to getting those things wrong? The answer is yes. Does that mean we must wrap our minds around them by worrying and living in fear? I would say no (the Bible tells us not to worry but to have peace by walking in faith **2 Timothy 1:7**, **Colossians 3:15**). But we do need to endeavor to get these things right and allow them to motivate us to further spiritual growth. We must strive to understand everything the Bible offers, even if we fall short of doing that perfectly. We would do well to remember Paul’s words to Timothy in the passage below. 

{{% scripture p="1 Timothy 1:3-7 (NIV)" %}}

A good illustration of how some wish to go about this is a person who goes to the gym and avoids a lot of strenuous exercises by doing all the easy ones (the other extreme being the individual who does the difficult ones but performs them incorrectly). Despite what such a person may wish to think, the best “gains” come from the tough exercises that build muscle more effectively.  Far too many believers have either rigidly accepted false doctrines or distanced themselves from all the “controversial issues” without taking a position out of fear, compromise, or disinterest. Yet being on the wrong side of some of them (whatever teaching/doctrine it is) has caused some of, if not the most tremendous amount of harm and damage in the church (whether those in the wrong want to believe it or not). Worse to tell, this damage will manifest itself to the extreme during the Tribulation. 

None of this is to say there have and are not great believers who have and do err on some of these doctrinal areas (there have been many spiritually mature and great heroes of the faith who adhere to some false teachings, and there are a sizeable amount of believers like that today). However, the more we get right, the closer we can grow to the Lord and the more effective we can be for Him and His church without hindering the faith and growth of others. And we should never dare to think to ourselves, “Well, none of these things have affected my walk with the Lord all that much.” That may be true, but the harm such thinking inflicts likely does more damage to us than we may realize. It is irresponsible (coming from believers who should know better) to think that just because we may have fared well living for Christ despite holding to some majorly wrong views we had to unlearn does not mean others will fare as well as we have (some have even fallen away from the faith on account of being on the wrong side of the issue, whatever it may be, inexcusable as that may be). What may not have done as much damage to us could do far more to someone else and even change the course of their life (with spiritual apathy leading to apostasy being the worst-case scenario). False doctrine HAS done tremendous damage to the church (look no further than **Revelation 3:14-22**). So whether it has affected us to a lesser degree, we still need to be serious about the issue (even though we may have escaped said lies ourselves). 

We don’t learn everything overnight, and some (if not many) of the teachings in Scripture are difficult to ascertain. But just because something is challenging and may take years to learn does not mean we shouldn’t be looking. The Christian life is all about faith (knowledge is useless unless applied), which requires truth to nourish it for its own growth and survival. So, although we may be wrong about some major things, what matters is that we are at least trying to learn and grow in the truth (in general). It is all about our attitude (properly aligned through faith), not knowledge. If we continue to seek, we will eventually find.  

To sum up our word “doctrine,” what we believe will govern HOW we think and live. Proper biblical meditation requires the right motivation for spiritual growth, something that good, solid, foundational principles found only in sound Bible doctrine can create. 

#### **Reproof, Correction, and Instruction** 

The next word in our passage (**2 Timothy 3:16**) is reproof, which means convicting someone about something they need to hear (either for sinful misconduct or something else). All Scripture helps to convict us when (or before) we err (here is what we are supposed to do and not supposed to do; how we are supposed to think, speak, and live our lives). 

The above leads us to our next word, correction, and would refer to the next step in the process. Correction refers to the parts in Scripture that tell us HOW we can abstain from sin and all things evil, not just what to do and not do (stay away from this but embrace that), as is the case with our word reprove above. In other words, the order would be something like this; “Here is what you did wrong, what you need to do (reprove), and here is how you do the right things so as not to do the wrong ones (correct). The first points out the problem, while the second gives the solution. It is not enough to know what is sinful and what is not because it is crucial to understand how to overcome sin. 

Finally, the last word on our list is “instruction,” which involves applying the truth. It is not enough to know what to do and how to do it because we must put those things into practice, which Scripture (hidden in our hearts **Psalm 119:11** and applied through the Spirit’s strength through faith **Galatians 5:16-18**) empowers us to do. The Bible exhorts us to be hearers of the Word **and doers** (**James 1:22-25**). We may have all the head knowledge of what to do and how to do it, but we must use what we know! That is complete knowledge lived out. Therefore, instruction completes the picture in the multi-stepped process of spiritual growth so that the “*Man of God may be **complete**, fully equipped for every good work*” (**2 Timothy 3:17**). 

The truth can only benefit us if we apply it in faith because God does not care about mere, unused head knowledge by itself. The Word of God is “*sharper than any two-edged sword*” (**Hebrews 4:12**) and is more than empty facts but has the power to transform! The belt of truth mentioned in **Ephesians 6:10-18** (the armor of God) refers to our need to know the facts, while the sword of the Spirit indicates the power contained in that truth and manifested in our lives. We first need to learn the Word (seek it out, understand it, and then believe it- the belt of truth) to apply it (the sword of the Spirit).

#### **B. Honorable, just, pure, lovely, and commendable** 

The Greek word for honorable is semnos σεμνός and means “worthy of respect,” “noble” (as the NIV translates it), and “dignified.” Like the other virtues in this passage, this one stems from the truth. As said earlier, what could anyone consider honorable, just, pure, lovely, and commendable if the truth were unknown (the extreme of relativism)? Our word involves thoughts, words, and actions that align with this same truth (good character qualities we possess or should possess and see in other believers). 

Our next word is just (rendered as “right” in other versions) and refers to all biblical commands and truth aligned with God’s holy character. It involves thinking about and practicing justice and righteousness that aligns with God’s standards. God is righteous and just. Therefore, being the same requires thinking like it (meditating on Scripture, which is the very mind of Christ **1 Corinthians 2**). It isn’t just knowing what is true but internalizing and applying it (**2 Corinthians 5:21**, **Philippians 3:9**). God has given us His righteousness because, without Him in our lives, we could do nothing good **Romans 7:18**. 

The Greek word for pure is Hagnos ἁγνός and means “without moral defect or blemish, pure and holy.” In other words, our thoughts should be on God’s moral standards and not on doing evil **Genesis 6:5** (immorality is the result). Our thoughts, motives, and intentions should be pure so that our behavior will be likewise. God’s Word is perfect and holy and requires our obedience. It is reliable (free of guile and falsehood) and can be trusted because it is without error and evil **James 3:17**.   

The word lovely in Greek is prosphilēs προσφιλής and means “pleasing, lovely, and acceptable.” Two commentators (of whom Gotquestions.org also quotes and which I found agreeable) describe the word " lovely as *“a rare word referring to things that attract, please, and win other people’s admiration and affection. Such thoughts bring people together in peace rather than separating them in fighting and feuding*” (Anders, M., *Galatians—Colossians*, Vol. 8, Broadman & Holman, 1999, p. 262). The other commentator states, “*The basic meaning of the word is ‘that which calls forth love, love-inspiring,’ and here it has the passive sense of ‘lovely, pleasing, agreeable, amiable*” (O’Brien, P. T., *The Epistle to the Philippians*, Eerdmans, 1991, p. 505). Based on how they define these words, we can confidently say that thinking about lovely things means dwelling on those things that promote love, peace, and unity. 

Our final word is commendable (euphēmos, εὔφημος) and means “well-sounding, appealing, and not offensive to people.” I would describe this as thinking, speaking, and doing things that would help ourselves and others instead of hurting or provoking them (truths aligned with Christian virtues). 

Finally, since all these listed virtues are “morally excellent” and “worthy of praise,” we must contemplate them because Paul taught them as necessary for us to apply. That is why verse nine says, “*What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—**practice these things**, and the God of peace will be with you.”* 

## **A Few Old Testament Passages** 

Many Old Testament passages provide good examples of believers who kept the truth foremost in their minds, whether circumstances were easier or harder. King David and the Psalms provide us with many excellent example passages that can’t help but inspire those who read them to do likewise. Due to the large volume of passages throughout the Old Testament where the subject of “meditation” appears, we cannot give a comprehensive list of verses. Nevertheless, we will content ourselves to briefly survey them with a few added comments here and there to end this study. But before we finish, we need to briefly discuss the word dispensationalism. 

### **Dispensations and Dispensationalism** 

First, the Old Testament saints did not have the completed canon of Scripture available to them (which means they didn’t have all the Scripture to mediate on that we do today). This means that they took to heart and obeyed whatever portions of Scripture were accessible (if any) or any other information they garnered through walking close to the Lord in faith as He revealed more of Himself to them through their own life experiences. Some did not even have the Law or any written part of Scripture (such as Adam, Enoch, Abraham, Job, etc.). Nevertheless, the Lord still provided all the necessary means for these great people of God to grow spiritually, provisions that these believers took advantage of through faith (look no further than **Hebrews 11**-the Christian life is all about faith and not knowledge!). This fact tells us that spiritual maturity isn’t based on how much we know (mere head knowledge by itself) but how much we apply through faith in proportion to what we know! With that said, if we want to grow more in our faith by applying more of the truth, we need to seek out as much of it as we can (failing to do so will stunt our spiritual growth). 

The correct meaning of “**dispensationalism**” refers to distinct periods differing in HOW God has chosen to “dispense” His truth to the world throughout history. The truth itself has not changed, but the manners in which God has chosen to reveal Himself it have differed from period to period. Dr. Luginbill defines and describes this word well when he says- 

 {{% quote text="SR2" src="https://ichthys.com/mail-Dispensations-Church.htm" %}}

The key is to be found in the word *oikonomia* "dispensation" ([Eph.1:10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph.1.10); [3:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph 3.2); [3:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph 3.9); [Col.1:25](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Col.1.25); [1Tim.1:4](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1 Tim.1.4)), of which Paul for instance tells us he is a *diakonos* or steward ([Col.1:25](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Col.1.25); a synonym of which is *oikonomos*, a word closely akin to *oikonomia* and also used for the one who dispenses the truth of God; cf. [1Cor.4:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1 Cor.4.1); [Tit.1:7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Titus.1.7); Pet.4:10). One can easily see the word "economics" (i.e., in Greek the management of a household, in this case God's "whose household we are") in the former and "deacon" in the latter (in Greek a servant who works in the household). 

{{% /quote %}}  

Today, we have God's complete and written Word necessary for our spiritual well-being. However, this was not true for many living under the Old Covenant. The Lord chose to reveal Himself and provide all the necessary information needed for spiritual growth through various forms of communication, such as signs, wonders, Christophanies, visions, dreams, and other divine manifestations of Himself and the truth He offered. This truth means that the Lord would commonly spoke with some of His chosen servants face to face (as He did with Abraham and Moses, who acted as His witnesses). Please understand that we’ve listed here only a few of the most prominent examples of ways (also known as dispensations) in which the Lord chose to communicate the truth. How He does so depends on the circumstances and where we are in history.

For example, the phrase, “Or any other information they garnered through walking close to the Lord in faith as He revealed more of Himself to them through their own life experiences,” applied to all the Old Testament believers but especially those before the giving of the Pentateuch (such as Adam and Enoch as only two out of many examples). Before the giving of the Law, the patriarchs would help to be God’s witnesses to spread His truth (using all that God provided them absent the written code, i.e., the Law of Moses). Then came the nation of Israel and the giving of the Law and the priesthood (another type of dispensation), along with the prophets (along with some Old Testament books) who acted in the Lord’s stead to help warn the nation and provide them with direct information from Himself. Next came Christ’s advent on earth (the incarnate Jesus Christ teaching His people directly), then the apostles (along with the sign gifts), and then the permanent indwelling of the Holy Spirit along with the written Word of God in completed form (precisely what we have today in the church age, including pastors and missionaries who help “dispense” the truth). Finally, the Millennium (the final period of human history before eternity’s commencement) will see a combination of some of the above manifestations (dispensations) since “the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord **Habakkuk 2:15**, **Jeremiah 31:31-34**.  

So, the conclusion from the above is that believers during Old Testament times set their minds on whatever truth was available to them regardless of the form in which it came. They did not know as much as we do today (many truths and details still veiled in mystery) because they did not have the completed Bible. But what they had available was enough to sustain their spiritual growth. The great heroes of the faith (some of the greatest believers of all time), such as Noah, Moses, David, Elijah, Abraham, and the like, were so because of their faith in what they received. The fact that they had less information available to them was not a result of any failing on their part but was because of how God chose to reveal Himself during those times. Sadly, despite today’s believers having more time, resources, and information, they are doing far less in proportion to what they have than many of those in biblical times who came before them. It is staggering to see just how little faith plays in the lives of so many Christians today. 

### **Israel and the Church are Synonymous Yet Distinct Parts of the Same Body** 

One final clarifying point I would like to make before we continue discussing our main subject is that although the church age (also known as the time of the Gentiles) began almost two thousand years ago, the church has always consisted of all true born-again believers from Adam up to our present time and on to the final believer to draw breath before eternity's commencement. That is to say, the church came into existence from Adam onward instead of at the day of Pentecost (Pentecost only began a new dispensation in God's plan for His church). Additionally, the church has not replaced believing Israel (those few Jewish believers left who do still believe) because Israel is just as much a part of it as anyone else. In other words, a believing Jew is just as much a part of the church as a believing Gentile. However, only believers are part of the church so that not all Israel (by physical descent only) is true Israel (all those of the faith of Abraham) **Romans 9:6-7**. We are discussing believers here. 

**Dr. Luginbill** writes (in describing why we call the past two-thousand years the "church age" when the church actually began with Adam): : 

{{% quote text="SR2" src="https://ichthys.com/mail-Dispensations-Church.htm" %}}

"It is correct to call our present time "the Church Age", since these two thousand years (rapidly running to their conclusion) are the time of the great influx of the gentiles into the Body of Christ (which I take to be the point behind wanting to begin at Acts 28), the filling up of our Lord's Assembly or Church, a process greatly helped and accelerated by the Spirit's unique ministry in our time."

{{% /quote %}} 

For more information regarding the meaning of the word "church," please see the link below (response #6) by **Dr. Luginbill**. 

https://ichthys.com/mail-Dispensations-Church.htm 

So what are the distinctions and/or differences (other than their role and physical lineage) between the "church age" (the past 2,000 years of church history known as the time of the Gentiles) and Israel if they are both part of the church (the church not having replaced Israel)? As we have already mentioned above under that section, a dispensation is a particular era of time based on HOW God chooses to reveal His truth to believers and unbelievers alike. Therefore, the only major thing that divides Israel from the church age is the different ways in which God chose to reveal His truth to believers and unbelievers during those respective periods. 

Therefore, believing Israel is part of the church (they have not been rejected or set aside but only those who have willfully rebelled against God in their unbelieving hearts **Romans 11**) and vice versa (all believing Gentiles are Israelites in the spiritual sense), and both should not be separated or distinguished except when describing the dispensational differences and Israel's unique role and physical lineage. **Romans 9:4-5** states, **4**."*They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises*. **5** *To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen*." God chose Israel as His special people to be a light and witness to the world). 

{{% scripture p="Galatians 3:25-29 (ESV)" %}} 

**25** But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, **26** **for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith**. **27** For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. **28** **There is neither Jew nor Greek**, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, **for you are all <u>one</u> in Christ Jesus**. **29** **And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise**.

**6** But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, **7** and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” **8** **This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring**.

{{% /scripture %}} 

We are all part of the body of Christ (both Jew and Gentile alike). Still, the Jewish people play a special role in that body despite the hardness of heart that has ruled most of them for almost two millennia (**Romans 11:25**). This does not make Israel any better than anyone else simply because God had to choose someone to be His initial representatives to the world, just as Moses was the Lord's chosen leader over Israel. The point is that someone had to be selected to do the job, those whose hearts were open and willing through faith (not because they were better than anyone else by themselves). We are all part of the same tree but consist of different parts or sections (see **Romans 11**). Therefore, it would be misleading to say that Israel is not part of the church (or that the church started only until Gentiles started believing in mass numbers) because technically, all believers are sons of Abraham by faith (which means that all believing Gentiles are also part of Israel). Gentiles, too, began to believe around the time of the apostles up to our present day and were "grafted" into the body of Christ through faith. **Galatians 3:7-9** says, "**7** *Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham*. **8** *Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you*.” **9** *So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith*." It's all about faith because that is how we relate to God. In summary, just because one group is a "hand" used for one purpose while the other is a "foot" used for a distinct and unique role does not separate either member from the body because they are still part of it (**1 Corinthians 12:21-26**). Faith is what makes the church what it is.  

With all the above out of the way, we will resume and complete our examination. Meditation isn’t always thinking about a handful of biblical passages, but also focusing and concentrating on all the good things the Lord has done for us in the past (counting our blessings included). **Psalm 77:11-12** says, “*I will remember the deeds of the* *Lord;* *yes, I will remember your wonders of old. I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds*. 

For example, the Israelites would have done well to remember/think about/meditate on the Lord’s great dealings with them as they (either negatively or positively) responded to His provisions throughout their journeys. Unfortunately, many failed to keep these things at the front of their thinking as they slipped away into rebellion. With that said, we will continue.

{{% /scripture %}}  

The passages above are only a small handful out of the many other Psalms that talk about the word “meditation” (the Hebrew root of the word being hāḡâ הָגָה). All three have this idea of vocalizing or uttering one’s thoughts aloud, often through murmurings, prayer, or song. As we stated earlier in this study, how we choose to meditate (whether quietly or aloud through worship, music, or murmuring) isn’t important because what truly matters is what goes on in our hearts. Is the truth at the center of our thoughts expressed through our prayers and songs? If we want to praise and worship the Lord pleasingly, we need to make sure our hearts are purified with the right attitude, motives, and necessary truth to make it meaningful (**John 4:24** says we must worship in truth). Otherwise, we are just wasting our time. 

{{% scripture p="Isaiah 26:3 (ESV)" %}}    

You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.                                                                                 

{{% /scripture %}}   

**Isaiah 26:3** does need to be interpreted in its context, but it still applies to our present subject. Having a steady mind set on Christ and His Word through faith results in obedience that produces peace. In other words, our hearts are bent on doing things God’s way. 

### **The Example of King David**  

Time and space do not permit us to scour through more example passages of the word “meditate,” and it is safe to say we have thoroughly examined it enough so that we can understand the idea by now. David did not write all the Psalms, but his authorship is unquestioned throughout many of them, and he provides a great example of what it means to have a firm commitment to the Lord. Indeed, he is known as a man after God’s own heart because he had the truth foremost in mind and acted according to it despite many of the harrowing ordeals he faced. This truth should inspire us to give our best to the Lord regardless of circumstances. Spiritual growth is a twenty-four-seven business that never stops as long as we live in these physical bodies because there will always be a continuous need to take in the Word and wield it as the sharp weapon it is **Hebrews 4:12**, **Ephesians 6:10-18**. Indeed, Scripture can discern, convict, and empower us to straighten out our priorities to use all it contains. The truth is powerful; more powerful than anything we can or have seen with our very eyes.

{{% scripture p="2 Peter 1:16-21 (ESV)" %}}    

**16** For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. **17** For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,” **18** we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. **19 And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed**, **to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place**, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, **20** knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. **21** For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.                                                                    

{{% /scripture %}}   

Like King David, we need to remember to walk by faith and not by sight despite whatever difficulties we may face **2 Corinthians 5:7**. Here was a man who constantly identified himself with the truth (whatever was available to him in his day) in thought, word, and deed while faced with some of the most excruciatingly difficult tests of faith any believer ever had to endure. Despite his imperfection, he was great for a reason and will rank high in the eternal kingdom. True, he is only one of many examples of men and women in the Bible who provide a role model for us to follow. Nevertheless, David habitually sought the Lord with all His heart so that his life revealed what was constantly on his mind. In conclusion, let’s also do the same. We are what we think and think about what we value most. And if we truly do value the Lord and His Word as we should, it will reflect in our lives as our lifestyles speak for themselves.
