title: Cryptozoology and the Bible
weight: 1200
summary: As mentioned in the study itself, this work is to assure the believer that paranormal/demonic-cryptid activity in no way disproves but supports the existence of a Creator. We must trust in God and His Word with all our heart regardless of what is seen and reported in this world.

## **Introduction** 

As everyone who has read a good bit of this ministry knows well, my goal is to help my listeners advance in their spiritual growth. However, this topic we will discuss may seem a bit wacky and perhaps, out of place. I don't blame anyone who reads this who may find it strange but rest assured there is a crucial reason I decided to write on this subject. The purpose of this work may not be apparent at first, but the longer you read, the more you will understand why I chose to write this. I encourage the reader to read this entire study from start to finish.  

According to Oxford Languages and Google, cryptozoology is "*The search for and study of animals whose existence or survival is disputed or unsubstantiated*." Examples of “so-called” cryptids include the loch ness monster, sasquatch, ropen, chupacabra, thunderbird, mokele-mbembe, the jersey devil, Ogopogo, etc. Whether many of these creatures exist is disputed. 

On the other hand, I believe that some (even many) of these creatures are real. I believe most of them aren't what people think they are (there has been a lot of deception outside the body of Christ and even some within leading people astray into believing other realities exist that disprove the existence of a Creator- or at the very least keep some people from coming to Christ or lead them astray from their relationship with Him), and that is where I play my part to tell the believer (and the unbeliever contemplating this issue) not to worry about the sightings regarding particular creatures. Cryptids (or just the paranormal in general) are not things we need to worry about; nor should we focus on them. We are not here to examine cryptids, very few, because that is not my goal here. My intent for the reader is to help them see how all of these things involving the paranormal should cause them no fear about what they know to be true from the Bible. 

This examination is a sharing of what I believe the Lord has revealed to me after seeking the truth from Him for many years. Throughout the narrative, I will share my personal story, journey, if you will, and how I came to the opinions that I did. I would also like to express my thoughts and beliefs on the topics we will discuss, including showing my take of what others have said on the subject of cryptids, cryptozoology, and their relationship to the spiritual realm. 

**Note**- This writer does not follow, recommend, endorse or support any of the authors (except for Dr. Luginbill of [Ichthys.com](https://www.ichthys.com)) and their works mentioned/quoted in this paper. However, I have chosen not to “throw the baby out with the bathwater” and have carefully selected those quotes that I believe are either correct or possibilities. And of course, this was done with all due respect. 

The subject of cryptozoology is often “under the radar” in Christian circles. This topic has undoubtedly caused at least some believers to waver in their faith. So if there is a problem, it needs to be addressed to whatever extent we can handle it. That is **not** the same thing as getting our minds wrapped around the subject, something this writer **does not encourage**. Our focus should be on Jesus at all times. 

However, satanic obstacles need to be seen for what they are. Problems must be dealt with and exposed so that other believers don’t become shocked or surprised about what they see and hear. We, the church, need to face the reality that there is much we don't fully understand and yet know in this world, but that there are some things we can comprehend with some clarity if we ask the Lord for greater understanding. Why should the church be surprised if certain things once thought unreal turn out to be a reality? Then, once we comprehend them to some degree (if possible), we can move on from them. Of course, this doesn’t mean we can understand as much as we may like but that there are at least some things within our reach to some extent.

Of course, there are, undoubtedly, some undiscovered animals in this world, so I acknowledge that. If a believer has a passion for searching for new species because that is their thing, that is okay. There is nothing wrong with that (as long as it doesn't hinder their relationship with the Lord). It is a great thing to want to understand God's wonderful creation better. But as we shall see below, there is no doubt that not every so-called “cryptid” is entirely animal per se, if at all. We will get into that later. For this reason, the part of the definition for cryptozoology that says "animals" is not entirely true. 

Anything that causes (could cause) a believer to stumble (and things that lead unbelievers away from Christ as has happened with some of the things mentioned in this examination) needs addressing if the issue happens to come up and confuse people. If we suspect Satan is playing with our minds, we need to understand and acknowledge what is going on. In other words, we need to see things as they are. What if we believe the lies the evil one tells us? Think of the spiritual harm that will cause! 

All of what I speak here will become more apparent and mesh with what I am saying the further we go in this examination. We don't have to understand some things perfectly or much at all; we just need to acknowledge their possible reality and the threat they could/may pose to those of weaker faith and less discernment. The best approach when dealing with demonic creatures/forces is to live and act as if they aren’t even there. However, this is not a paradox because that is not the same thing as living in denial that some or many of the cryptids often reported aren't possibly real. The real issue is whether we will allow ourselves to be deceived or see things for what they probably are (if indeed they are real).                                                            

Before we dive into this, I would like to say that my knowledge of cryptids (much like the rest of the world) is limited. I will also note that the topic of this paper is not actually about cryptozoology itself but about how believers need not worry about what their eyes may see and ears hear. I want to assure my brothers and sisters in Christ that the paranormal in no way disproves the Biblical narrative and that the Bible is entirely true from start to finish. By doing this, we return to the theme of preparing for the tribulation. And what better time to talk about this issue than now! 

For this reason, believers should not be surprised when the media and news outlets report sightings of the "unusual" (UFOS), for this is only a sign that we are getting closer to the end. There is much demonic activity in this world, increasing more and more as the years wind down. My warning to believers-  stay focused on the mission the Lord has assigned you to complete. But see the danger as it is! Don't be led astray into unbelief because you mistook what you may have seen or heard for something that it was not. 



## **1. Discovering the Truth - My Story** 

**Please note**: Nothing below is being used as proof or evidence for the existence of the things under discussion. I am only sharing my story to explain to the reader (since it is inevitable that some will ask how and why I came to the opinions that I did) how all this came about (the backdrop to all this).  

The subject of cryptids and cryptozoology has interested me for a long time. When I was in high school (eleventh grade), I wrote a research paper on this very matter in 2013 and 2014. Much to my disappointment (especially when I look back on it now), my work didn't turn out too good. It was nothing but an extensive collection of mysterious sightings and so-called "evidence" of the existence of a small handful of creatures unknown to science. However, this would kickstart my interest in the topic. 

A few years after I had finished eleventh grade, my interest in cryptozoology faded, and I researched it spontaneously- that is, until October of 2020. But this time, the issue was more personal, and I changed from just "researching" **to relying on God to grant more insight**. Big difference! 

## **Cryptozoology has yielded some results** 

Before continuing my story, I feel it is worth mentioning that a good handful of cryptozoological animals (or creatures that used to be cryptids) have come to light over the years. Examples are the giant squid (once described as the Kraken), the komodo dragon, the kangaroo, the gorilla, the okapi, the platypus, the bondegezou, the manatee, etc. These are just some of the most prominent examples of cryptids discovered decades to hundreds of years ago. Once thought to be mythological, they turned out to be real! And there are, no doubt, other species of animals that man has yet to discover. So cryptozoology is not a complete joke and has had some success over the years. 

## **Our trust and focus is on Christ, not on what we hear and see** 

Unfortunately, some believers have taken their love for the “unknown” too far, resulting in spiritual harm (especially regarding the paranormal which doesn't necessarily involve animals). It is likely that many people get sucked into this kind of stuff only to come to dangerous and unbiblical conclusions. Scripture is the ultimate authority by which we think, speak, and act (**2 Peter 1:16-21**). Believers must not obsess over demonic activity or become overly fascinated with the paranormal. We simply acknowledge the reality and continue striving forward in our relationship with the Lord as if they didn’t exist. We must not allow the invisible, and sometimes visible satanic realm to carry us away from the truth. Our focus is on Jesus, not on this world and all the evil therein. So for those (especially believers) who may have had a "run in" with something unusual that they could not explain (paranormal), there is nothing to fear. There is always an explanation behind everything. Christians should never allow what their eyes, ears and feelings tell them to lead them astray. We walk by the Spirit according to the truth of God's Word rightly understood and believed. For those who do this, they will not be fooled; nor will they stumble. 

Alright, now to my story. As mentioned previously, my fascination with cryptids began many years ago (before I came to understand these matters better) when I decided I would write a research paper on them. As I already mentioned, it didn't turn out too good, and I eventually concluded that much of what had interested me never existed at all. I never mentioned sasquatch or UFOs (the two primary **examples** we will use in this study) in my paper because I thought they were a complete joke, which only idiots believed in and claimed to see. I take all that back now! How judgmental and ignorant I was! 

Many years had passed since I wrote my research paper. But I do remember praying (from the get-go) to the Lord something along the lines of, "*Lord, I pray that you would clarify these matters to me someday in the future*." My enthusiasm for cryptids and cryptozoology faded somewhere in the mid-two-thousands teens till October 2020, when I found myself scrolling around on youtube. I researched Patapsco Valley State Park, a local state park roughly 15 minutes from where I lived (I grew up in Maryland but moved). The park is massive (growing to 16,000 acres and over 32 miles long over the years), spanning as far east as Elkridge to as far west as Sykesville. All in all, there are 170 miles of trails throughout the park. There used to be other swaths of forest and marshland outside its boundaries, making it an even larger wilderness area. https://www.sierraclub.org/maryland/patapsco-valley-state-park 

Elkridge, a town on the borders of Patapsco Valley State Park, got its name because of the large herds of elk that used to roam the area. Elk, black bears, and other large megafauna have since gone extinct (elk) or dwindled to only a few individuals (black bear).  

https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2001-02-27-0102270053-story.html  

The park and the surrounding wilderness that used to exist were once home to Native Americans who inhabited the area many years ago. Today, however, many places around Patapsco have become urbanized and crowded with houses, industrial buildings, public schools, and all kinds of stores and shopping centers. As a result, the area surrounding the park isn't nearly as wild and remote as it used to be. After all, it sits not far outside Baltimore city, surrounded by urban living areas and various towns. In addition, the park spans four counties, Anne Arundel, Howard, Baltimore, and Carroll Counties. 

I researched Patapsco Valley State park to gauge its boundaries and see where it went and ended. I was always fascinated with the place because I had hiked it many times and had explored and fished various parts of it. I considered it my playground! I must have explored my favorite sections a million times. Trail running was another favorite of mine, and occasionally trout fishing in the spring when the river contained stocked rainbow and brown trout.

 Anyway, I entered "Sykesville" or "Patapsco State Park, Sykesville in the search bar." I then noticed a video entitled "*Hiding Evidence of the Sykesville Monster/ Monsters and Mysteries in America*" (dealing with a sasquatch sighting that occurred back in 1981). So I was glad I found it, clicked on the link, and watched the whole thing from start to finish. It was this incident/sighting that would arouse my curiosity and cause me to go to the Lord for clarity. But there is more that spurned me on. I was astonished by the video I had just watched of this account and wanted to find out more if anything else had occurred in the park. There had been other sightings over the years. I was perplexed about this whole matter and began to go to the Lord for answers. But it was not just this incident that aroused my suspicion, but I had found many others that had taken place! Over the past few hundred years, there have been thousands of sightings and encounters with these creatures in North America and all over the world. They have occurred on multiple continents, including North America, Australia, and Asia. Far too many incidents to discount. But it didn't stop there. 

I thought I was done with sasquatch and cryptozoology until I found myself looking at books on the subject. I found one called "*Enoch: A Bigfoot Story"* by Autumn Williams. I ordered it, along with another titled "*How UFOs & Bigfoot Prove the Bible is True* by Jason Mclean. I dove into Autumn William's book first. I read with an open and discerning mind and finished it within a matter of days. When it was all said and done, I came to believe that these creatures do exist, and that there are many of them across the world (as unbelievable as it may seem to those less informed and enlightened, much of this is due to this very subject being misunderstood and clouded by skeptics and hoaxes). This was, for me, a matter of putting two and two together based on the obvious. Therefore, I interpreted all this to mean that this was the reality based on multiple eyewitness reports (in the thousands worldwide) and Native American testimonies going back hundreds of years (perhaps more). This challenged me to think "If these things aren't real, why have so many thousands of people claimed to have seen them over the years? And why do more sightings keep occurring? But why is it no absolute proof of their existence (in whatever form) has been brought to the public's attention?" I think the possible explanation given below (and the fact that the government doesn't want the public to know or say much about what is out there) for what these creatures are help to explain that because if these creatures were ordinary animals, the entire public would know about them and they would not be so hard to spot. 

As for putting two and two together, the more sightings there have been and that have continued, the more I came to believe that it wasn't just all or mostly nonsense (even if some of it undoubtedly was and is). **1 Samuel 3:2-9** was a passage that came to my mind when contemplating this issue. After three visits, Eli eventually had to conclude that something was up and that someone was actually calling Samuel. It turned out to be the Lord, not Eli himself. In my own mind, I could not keep rejecting something as false with thousands of people reporting the same thing for hundreds of years up to our present time. Perhaps it sounds arrogant and ridiculous to say that what I believe to be true is something that seems a bit obvious to me. However, that is how I genuinely feel. I don't see it as arrogant.  

So if these creatures are real, what are they? It is important that we don't chase after this and go too far because that can become a distraction to our faith. But some reasonable speculation is allowable. 

The book by Autumn Williams contains many excerpts/quotes from her friend documenting his interactions with these “skunk apes” (that is what people call them in Florida and other Southeastern states). Not only does he claim to be a long-term witness, but also says he befriended one of these creatures and called him Enoch (based on the noises the creature would make when he would knock on a tree). Later, he would interact with more of them and better understand them through personal observation and interaction. I found the book quite convincing. But the reader must be careful not to believe everything they read, and even if we do believe something, we must be cautious.  

Anyway, the more sightings I researched, the more I became convinced that these creatures were real, primarily since Native Americans have spoken of living alongside them for hundreds and even thousands of years. However, some of the most interesting experiences in my view involved police officers and military personnel, many of whom were witnesses that came forward years after supposedly sighting and handling these creatures. It is very likely the government does not want the public to know about their existence; the Sykesville incident certainly suggests that. And that incident stands far from alone among dozens of possible government and military coverups. Unfortunately, time and space do not permit us to examine more of them here. Not only is it not possible, but one must consider that many witnesses never come forward at all, meaning that these creatures are most likely spotted and interacted with more often than people realize. Yet, many do not report any of this for fear of being ridiculed. 

I completed Autumn William’s book but still had the question of, "*what exactly are these creatures*?" Some have suggested that they are perhaps a missing link, proving that humans evolved from earlier primates. No surprise that unbelievers would propose this, and there is no doubt Satan is behind it. This theory is false because it contradicts the biblical truth that God created man in His own image and likeness. 

With the Lord's help, I came to understand the whole “bigfoot” phenomenon better. Thinking about what they might be made me wonder about the identity of other cryptids. Creatures such as the jersey devil, moth man, and others don't sound like ordinary animals. If dozens or hundreds of people have seen these things over the years, then I have no problem speculating that that is all demonic activity of some sort. 

## **What about other cryptids?** 

So what about the various lake monsters across the world and the thunderbird etc? I would not find it hard to believe if they were/are fully demonic creatures or demonically created genetic mutations. As far as lake monsters go, Ogopogo is possibly an excellent example of a “cryptid” that would fit the demonic bill pretty well. It just so happens that it is one of the most documented lake monsters in the entire world, with thousands of reported sightings. People have written books and even studied and analyzed a host of photos and videos, with some analysts suggesting positive authenticity without any tampering (despite how blurry and grainy so much of the photos and footage have turned out). Lake Okanagan, the 60-83 mile-long, eight-hundred to thousand-foot-deep lake (maximum) is where the creature is said to live. What is most striking is that many of the First Nations peoples living in that area have given this creature multiple names (something they wouldn’t do if it didn’t exist according to them). They believe it is no ordinary animal and one that isn't supposed to be seen. Some of these people believe it to be a god. But if we put two and two together, we can easily theorize that this is indeed a spiritual creature, just not in the way described. If it is real, it is most likely half-animal and half-demonic, or fully demonic, which could explain why people seldom see it. This answer is the best possibility we can give for something so-well sighted (although no clear proof has been provided), yet never caught (as far as the public is concerned). 

The reasonable explanation for Ogopogo could also explain all the other sightings of other aquatic “cryptids” worldwide, such as mokele mbembe, champ, the loch ness monster and Memphre. So they would not necessarily fall into the category of solely (if at all) “animals” per se. 

Many people (especially in more modern countries and communities) tend to scoff and poke fun at stories from people who claim to have experienced sighting strange and unexplained creatures unknown to us. Of course, it is still best to be cautious and not believe everything we hear, but it is also possible that some of the people who describe these creatures are telling the truth. The problem is when individuals go hunting for them only to come up short and declare that the target never existed at all (that is not a guarantee it isn’t real). There is no doubt that there are many creatures that come from myths, legends, rumors, and traditions passed down over the centuries. But some people could be mistaking demonic creatures for “animal gods” (as is likely the case with Ogopogo). This would be one of the Devil's ways of attempting to lead people astray from the true God (whatever creature is involved in whatever land). The good thing we can get out of all this is that it helps us remember that we are interlopers in Satan’s world system. We are but visitors here on earth who wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against this world's spiritual darkness’s and principalities (**Ephesians 6:12**). Satan and his companions are alive and well and God allows them to have their share of “freedom” and “fun.” 





## **2. Possible Answers and Explanations for Sasquatch** 

At some point in my search in May of 2021, I believed sasquatch was a real creature and that sizeable populations exist worldwide. But the question of their origin and identity remained. As mentioned previously, I read a book entitled "*How UFOs and Bigfoot Prove the Bible is True"* by Jason Mclean. Although there are many things I disagree with this author on in his book, I found some content reasonable.

As for what sasquatch could be, we will attempt to give a viable explanation. And no, I do not believe these creatures to be descendants of Esau because Scripture does not support that. Esau may have been hairy, but he was not that primitive (yes, we can chuckle at that). So again, that is an explanation that has no biblical basis. 

Jason Mclean writes- 

*"The spirits of Nephilim, instead of descending to Hell were allowed to wander the earth as demons (specifically the evil spirits that possess and oppress humans). The corruption brought by the Watchers and the Nephilim had so corrupted humanity (both genetically as well as morally) and wildlife that God sent the flood to destroy the previous earth.”*

There is more to this than what may appear on the surface. Like Jason Mclean, I too am against the Sethite view, which states that the Nephilim were "*corrupted rulers descended from Seth and not the giant hybrid offspring of angels and humans*"- quote by Jason Mclean." However, we have no concrete proof that the spirits of the Nephilim are the specific types of demons that possess and oppress humans. But such a theory is very plausible considering that they probably aren't presently in Hell (only those fallen angels responsible for creating them are currently bound and chained in another underworld compartment **Jude 6-7**, **2 Peter 2:4**). Therefore, like the rest of the fallen angels, it would make sense that the spirits of the Nephilim would be allowed a period of grace (time to wander the earth in freedom) before being dispatched into the lake of fire (which is presently unoccupied). 

We will post the passages relevant to this topic below to refresh our memory of what happened during this satanic attack before the flood. 

{{% scripture p="Genesis 6:1-8 (ESV)" %}} 

When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, **2** the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. **3** Then the Lord said, "My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years." **4** The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. **5** The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. **6** And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. **7** So the Lord said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them." **8** But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.

{{% scripture p="Jude 6-7" %}} 

**6** And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day. **7** In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.                                           

{{% /scripture %}} 

Jason Mclean states- 

*Note-1 Enoch confirms that it wasn't just humans the Watchers copulated with and there are additional texts that this is the origin of "monsters" like Sasquatch and others.* *At the very least we should view this as genetic manipulation and hybridization of human and animals genetics.* 

To clarify Mclean’s view on the book of Jasher he writes below, 

*Let me be very clear, the 1840 Jasher is NOT the same Book of Jasher referenced in the Old Testament. That being said, it is based on Jewish oral tradition that was compiled and written down in medieval Spain. It has certain teachings in the first few chapters that match with other traditions and legends found in pagan histories.* 

To add to the above, Mclean (as does this writer) does not believe the book of Enoch to be ""*canon or inerrant*." And nothing physical could have survived the flood sent to destroy all sinful mankind and the Nephilim. So if sasquatch is demonic in origin and physical (it may be both spiritual and physical- although this is hard to say with any certainty), it would had to have been created by the spirits of the Nephilim after the great deluge through genetic manipulation. 

## **Genetic manipulation, hybridization, the Genesis gap, and the fossil record** 

As a quick additional side discussion of demons practicing "genetic manipulation" and "hybridization", Dr. Luginbill states what he does below regarding the fossil record i.e. prehistoric animals, creatures and dinosaurs. Please note that although dinosaurs have nothing to do with “bigfoot”, the purpose of bringing this up is to show the reader that fallen angels could procreate with both humans and genetically manipulate animals (though the Bible already confirms this in Genesis chapter six as far as “reproducing” with humans goes). 

We must remember that God initially created the earth for angels who (along with other/prehistoric flora and fauna) inhabited the planet we now live on. This world ended when Satan sinned and rebelled against God, leading one-third of angels (now known as fallen angels) into apostasy. At some point, God then blacked (He did not annihilate it) out the earth and universe and cleansed it, only to recreate/refurbish it to make way for humanity (so no young earth creationism). Humans (among those who would choose for God) would replace Satan and his legions. The purpose was to replace what was lost. By doing this, God would also demonstrate His power, righteousness, justice, and perfection right before the eyes of angels (both elect and fallen). God has already defeated Satan! But history has to run its course first. For more information on the Genesis Gap and the Satanic rebellion, see [Part 2 of the Satanic Rebellion series on Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/sr2-copy.htm). 

Dr. Luginbill states- 

*Given the demons' longing for physical bodies and the integral part in Satan's plan that the satisfaction of that desire played (see [part 1](https://ichthys.com/SR1copy.htm)), it is not unreasonable to suppose that much of the fascinating fossil record of the archaic earth we now possess is a result of the devil's manipulation and misuse of the earth's original fauna for just such purposes: the Bible's identification of Satan with reptiles (dragons, serpents), and his obvious fascination with the same (cf. Gen.3), make the possibility of this theoretical satanic origin of the terrible, powerful creatures of pre-history all the more conceivable.*

As a quick side note, since the time from when Satan rebelled to when God blacked out and then "refurbished" the earth could have spanned eons of time (the Bible doesn't tell us), this would (as mentioned above) eliminate young earth creationism (and could also be to blame for why so many believers abandon Christianity for evolution and atheism). However, as far as man and all the re-created plant and animal life are concerned (the seven days of re-creation mentioned in Genesis), those have only been around for (in this writers view) roughly six thousand years. For more information on the seven thousand years of human history, please see the following link by Dr. Luginbill. https://ichthys.com/Satans-Rebellion-Part5.htm#Seven%20Days%20of%20Human%20History 

I would like to add that I agree with Robert’s interpretation above. Why would our Lord allow terrible, viscous reptiles that could kill so many individuals to live alongside people after the fall of Adam and Eve? Even “dinosaur” comes from the Greek word *deinos, which means* ‘**terrible**’ *sauros* ‘**lizard**’. It is highly unlikely that changing climate would explain the extinction of EVERY SINGLE species we have available to us in the fossil record. And why reptiles (and not mammals) of such gigantic size? Well, Satan has a fascination with them; we know that from the garden of Eden. It makes far better sense for us to attribute most of the fossil record to before God's blacking out of the universe but after Satan’s rebellion (sometime between the two) since demons crave bodies which they lack as purely spiritual beings (**Matthew 8:28-34, Mark 5:1-20, Luke 8:26-39**). 

The coexistence of gigantic and dangerous “lizards” living alongside humans doesn’t make much sense. It seems that these terrifying creatures were never meant to live alongside man. And if they ever did at any point, it must have been during the entire period of the Satanic attack resulting in the Nephilim mentioned in Genesis six. So this would eliminate our arguments above (about the dangers of dinosaurs living with man). Since a group of voluntary fallen angels cohabited with human women, it is also possible that (as already mentioned) genetic manipulation occurred with wildlife as well. This may have resulted in **some** of what we know as dinosaurs and other large, powerful land and aquatic reptilian and mammalian species. However, it is more likely that (to say the least)  dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures were a result of genetic manipulation that occurred after Satan's rebellion before God blacked out the universe. This would have been long before God "refurbished" the earth and placed man on it (the Genesis Gap). 

However, there is nothing to disprove the possibility that the Genesis six incident explains at least some of the fossil record. These voluntary angels would have simply repeated what they did long before God blacked out the earth for re-recreation. Nevertheless, there is one thing we can know for certain- **there were never any dinosaurs on Noah's ark**. 

To continue our main discussion, I encourage readers to avoid the Apocrypha. The problem is that many Christians don't have the knowledge or discernment to pick out the good from the bad works (forgery vs. non-forgery). Many mistakes do not agree with Scripture throughout many of the pseudiographical works, so one must be careful while reading through the various books. That is not to say there is no truth and value in the Apocrypha (we just referenced it as a possible clue), but caution must be advised. The book of Enoch and Jasher is not canonical. Therefore, what they say regarding the Spirits of the Nephilim tampering with animal genetics sometime after the flood may be inaccurate. However, we don't need written testimony to theorize that this did indeed happen since there has to be an explanation for many of the cryptozoological creatures we hear of today if some or most of them are in fact real. And it is factual (as we have touched on already) that the spirits of the Nephilim are still in fact present on the earth (they have been ever since the flood). Therefore, this is (as we will discuss below) the most likely explanation. 

We can be sure that all the Nephilim will end up in the lake of fire forever because they opposed God and never believed in Him for salvation. Since they were both human and fallen angel, they had the free will to do so. But their spirits are present on this earth because the rest of the fallen angels still have the freedom to move about freely (except for those involved in the creation of the Nephilim **1 Peter 3:19-20, Jude 6**). This will eventually cease toward the end of time when they are all thrown into the lake of fire.      

## **There are plausible reasons many cryptids are demonic in origin** 

To continue, there is no reason why creatures like sasquatch could not exist (and thus, no reason why the spirits of the Nephilim or some fallen angels could not have created them after the flood). They (along with many other cryptids) live in the most remote parts of the world, reproduce within their own species (some "cryptids" are claimed to be capable of reproduction) want little to do with humans, and keep themselves hidden out of sight. A sasquatch (or any other creature) does not compare well with the Nephilim in power, numbers, freedom, and influence. Therefore, God does not need to eradicate them (or prevent their creation) because they pose no threat to man as the Nephilim did. If sasquatch exists, then God (at some point after the flood) allowed the spirits of the Nephilim **or** some group of fallen angels not involved with corrupting the human seed to form the Nephilim  to“ create” these monsters, along with any other demonic creatures that roam our world. **I believe this is the best possible answer we can give**. 

As an additional note, demons genetically tampering with animals after the flood all the way up to our modern time would (assuming we go with the the theory that dinosaurs were a result of genetic manipulation by Satan's followers) not constitute doing something forbidden by God. The reason for this is because if Satan and his followers did tamper with the wildlife of the old original earth, then an attack on humans (reproducing with human women) would have already been a "no no." This would show us that fallen angels attacking humans (those made in the image and likeness of God) is different than attacking animals (since people have a greater purpose and value in God's eyes). For that and reasons already given above, there is no reason why genetic manipulation didn't occur with wildlife after the flood up to the present. But it is highly unlikely this ever occurred with people. Does this mean there aren't half human and half demonic beings in our world? That is possible, but would unlikely be a result of a demon cohabiting with a person. Fallen angels can probably appear in similar human form on their own. 

Although the above sounds strange, there is much fallen angels can and have done that we are not aware of. How do spiritual beings procreate with physical ones (whether human or animal)? How do they genetically tamper with wildlife? We don’t have to understand these things- we just have to believe them  because the Bible supports them. Robert writes on this point very well in the link below (see response #1). So the details of how all this occurs (as suggested in Robert's response) is going to be unknowable to us. Therefore, there is no point in speculating on that any further. 

[*https://ichthys.com/mail-nephilim-antichrist-false-prophet-mark-of-the-beast.htm*](https://ichthys.com/mail-nephilim-antichrist-false-prophet-mark-of-the-beast.htm) 

But what about other "cryptids" such as the moth man, jersey devil, chupacabra, dogmen, etc.? Many of these so-called creatures don't sound entirely animal based on the descriptions of their physical characteristics and behavior. This fact arouses my suspicion that much of what witnesses observe (you take the creatures just described as examples) is nothing more than demonic creatures with that origin. This theory could explain why people seldom see or document them, not necessarily because they can disappear (even though that’s possible), but because their demonic ancestry or makeup (whichever) gives them the intelligence they need to avoid the “spotlight.” So these creatures would be highly intelligent, far more than any of the fauna they share their habitat with. So it would probably be a waste of time even trying to search for something that knows how to remain hidden (and probably sees people while they don't see it). Yet, people try to discredit what others have seen by mentioning that they have hiked the forests and swamps for years and never seen anything unusual. "*Someone would have found these things by now*!" Well, as it turns out, plenty of people may have. Yet no one believes them, and many more witnesses have most likely not come forward due to fear of being ridiculed and losing their jobs. So, just because most people don't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And if that something has demonic ancestry, then no wonder! Also, the government is very likely well aware of many of these creatures so that they will go out of their way to destroy all proof and evidence to keep the public from discovering the truth. Additionally, many of these creatures are likely to inhabit the most remote areas within their range. 

And just because something is categorized as a conspiracy theory does not make it so or any less credible. There are some things that are mixed with lies making discovering the truth more difficult. I believe this to be the case with UFOs, sasquatch, and other possible demonic entities. In other words, I do not believe they fall under the category of “conspiracy theories” something this writer is not a fan of at all. We believers would do well to keep away from conspiracy theories. 



## **3. Explaining Aliens and UFOs** 

If “Aliens” and UFOs are real (as this writer believes they are), they are nothing more than demonic activity. **By themselves, aliens and UFOs do not exist**. Many wish to believe they do to elude the plain and simple truth that there is a God. Many want to believe that aliens are real so they can dismiss The Creator. There is no surprise they do this either because they hate our Savior and don't want Him to be their Lord. 

{{% scripture p="John 3:17-21 (NKJV)" %}} 

**17** For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. **18** "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. **19** And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. **20** For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. **21** But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God."                                                                             

{{% /scripture %}} 

The unbelieving world is quick to take anything and use it as “proof” that there is no God (even though the devil is leading them astray). And these critics ignore all the eyewitness testimonies and true written accounts from Scripture who witnessed the Biblical events. They purposely overlook natural revelation; oceans, mountains, animals, trees, plants, planets, galaxies, stars, and the list goes on. They ignore that things could not have just happened, that there had to have been a Creator who created all there is. By doing this, they ignore themselves, for their physical bodies further testify to God's existence. How intricate and wonderfully made is the human body! Only an intelligent designer could have made it! They ignore the prophecies of the Bible, all of which have come true except for the tribulation which is yet future. Everything else Scripture said would occur has taken place and is now part of human history as we know it, though the Bible is NO history book.

Additionally, there is the difference between right and wrong in the consciousness of every human being. Only God is perfect, which means that only He can impute righteousness to people (something He does only to those who believe in His Son Jesus Christ). This aspect of right and wrong (as well as the human spirit God has given to all men) is one of the things that sets humans apart from animals. God created man in His own image and likeness, which means that we humans can exercise authority and respond to it (our Creator) **Genesis 1:26-28**, something animals cannot do. 

{{% scripture p="2 Peter 1:18-21 (NIV)" %}} 

**19** We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. **20** Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. **21** For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

As subtle as they may be, miracles still happen today, just in different ways than in times past. Demonic activity is also rampant, perhaps more in the present than in any other time in history. We must state that those who don't believe in God hate it when you mention that much of the paranormal is demonic activity. The world wants to think it is "something else" because, in their minds, it could potentially disprove the existence of a supreme Creator. The reason is that demons help point to the existence of God because the Bible states that Satan and his legions are His arch-enemies. Satanic activity is everywhere! It occurs on every continent, in every country and culture. It happens every day! This point is extremely critical to contemplate. Why do people think we have witchcraft, sorcery, ghost, phantom, graveyard fetishes, false religions, gods and beliefs? 

{{% scripture p="Ephesians 6:11-13 (KJV)" %}} 

**11** Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. **12** **For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places**. **13** Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

Regarding false and multiple religions, that is nothing new. We have so many today vying for people's hearts, only to lead them to eternal destruction. The Bible tells us about the origin of false religion in Genesis chapter four when Cain tried to approach God through works (in his own way) apart from faith alone (as opposed to Abel who came to the Lord in faith with a sacrifice that represented Christ’s future death on the cross). Additionally, we have recorded the very first murder to occur. 

{{% scripture p="Genesis 4:1-8 (NIV)" %}} 

Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man." **2** Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. **3** In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord. **4** And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, **5** but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. **6** Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? **7** If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it." **8** Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.

This world is a battleground between the forces of God and Satan, and we believers sit in the middle of it. Those who reject our Lord choose Satan's side, while those who choose Christ oppose the evil one (**Matthew 12:22-28**). 

{{% scripture p="Matthew 12:30 (NASB 1995)" %}}

Yet most people choose to put God out of their minds, so they reject Him, despite the fact He has made Himself evident and accessible to all.

**18** The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, **19** since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. **20** For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. **21** For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. **22** Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools **23** and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles. **24** Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. **25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator**—who is forever praised. Amen.

Anyway, regarding UFOs, McLean states the following- 

*On December 16, 2017 the New York Times published an article with a video from an F/A-18F Super Hornet that pursued a UFO in 2004. The video was provided by the United States government which also publicly admitted that:* 

*1) UFOs are real*

*2) They invade our airspace with impunity.* 

*3) Their abilities demonstrate technology significantly more advanced than current US military aircraft.*                                           

*4) And that the US has spent millions of dollars researching them.*                                                                  

So there you have it. Not only have military craft observed these flying objects but, according to some witnesses, they have been known to disappear and then reappear at random. Again, we just have to put two and two together. This is only helping to lay the groundwork for the great deception ahead during the tribulation. As believers, we already know much demonic activity exists in this world; we know that without knowing about UFOs. So demon activity is alive in our world, just in a more subtle, under-the-radar way. 

Regarding UFO's again, Lynn E. Catoe States-

*"A large part of the available UFO literature is closely linked with mysticism and the metaphysical. It deals with subjects mental telepathy, automatic writing and invisible entities as well as phenomenon like poltergeist manifestation and possession. Many of the UFO reports now being published in the popular press recount alleged incidents that are strikingly similar to demonic possession and psychic phenomenon that have long been known to theologians and parapsychologists."* 

\-     *Lynn E. Catoe, Senior bibliographer for the Library of Congress, UFOs AND RELATED SUBJECTS: An Annotated Bibliography, 1969; prepared under Airforce Office of Scientific Research project* 

*Order 67-0002 and 68-003*  

Many unbelievers during the tribulation may very well believe that the antichrist, the false prophet, and the rest of the world’s possibly half-human/half demonic world leaders are extraterrestrial alien visitors. Not only that, there have been a lot of UFO reports in the news as of late, so we are beginning to see the evil one and his minions lay the groundwork for the great deception ahead. 

{{% scripture p="Revelation 13:11-15 (ESV)" %}}  

**11** Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. **12** It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed. **13 It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people**, **14 and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast it deceives those who dwell on earth**, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived. **15** And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain.                         

{{% /scripture %}}  

Additionally, we know that one-third of believers alive during the tribulation will fall away in the great apostasy to begin during the first half of the tribulation and reach its peak at the second. We know from Scripture that antichrist will pose as Christ Himself, which will cause many apostates to believe that he is God’s Son! False doctrine will undoubtedly contribute highly to this great falling away. However, many believers may (like many unbelievers) fall for the belief that the beast (and some of his henchmen) is extraterrestrial.

“UFOs,” “aliens,” and all other demonic manifestations are the devil's way of trying to distract the world (both believers and unbelievers alike) by dragging their attention away from God and onto lies that, if followed, could lead to eternal separation in the lake of fire. Former family research counselor Tim Dailey made an excellent point regarding bigfoot and the paranormal (aliens and UFOs). Below he states- 

*"It's part of the devil's modus operandi. He has always used this kind of phenomena to, once again destabilize, to engender fear, to open us up to the possibilities of other realities and other beings and then we begin getting involved with demonic spirits. So yeah, all through history there have been many, many different varieties of beings that are primarily spiritual beings that have terrorized civilizations and peoples and non-Christian cultures are very aware of this."*

## **"Alien abduction" or demonic possession?** 

People have reportedly contacted aliens (known as demons) and were “abducted”/possessed by them telepathically through the use of shamanic drugs and other methods. This phenomenon is a modern version of demonic possession, the only difference in this case being that people are going to demons, not demons to people. Whether demons can still take the initiative as they did during biblical times is disputed but of little concern to this writer. 

Mclean also notes that contactees and abductees are demonically attacked and "*subjected to humiliating and painful procedures to satisfy the desires of their abductors*." This is something that most in the church would find hard to accept, but the Bible nowhere tells us that this can’t or doesn’t occur. So no believer has any right to automatically dismiss such occurrences and say that "the Bible doesn't support such strange behavior in our times." True, but it neither says that it doesn’t occur either. But we know that satanic activity is alive and well for sure and that demonic possession still occurs today (in whatever ways). 

## **The limitations of science** 

Unfortunately, much of the unbelieving scientific community approach these issues with great doubt (about demonic possession and activity) because they are skeptical. This would be the other side of opposition instead of those who accept the reality of some to much of the paranormal but see it as something it isn't to put God out of their minds. Instead, these types of people (perhaps realizing that some are seeing the truth that much of the paranormal is in fact demonic activity) wish to wave their hands and proclaim that none of it is real at all (since the Bible teaches that Satan and his forces oppose this world and the true Ruler of it). Of course, the Tribulation and the short time before it will no doubt change their minds (except that what they see is something they will accept not as demonic but "something else" because of their stubbornness to acknowledge their Creator) . The problem is that we let science (which, more often than not, doesn't mix well with the Bible) dictate too much of what we believe. Yet what shock people often face when it turns out to be wrong. We know, for example, that biblical truth doesn't need science because it is a test of faith! The Bible and the realities of the unseen war around us (**Ephesians 6:12**) involve faith. Of course, that doesn’t mean we can’t use science to point people to Christ, for that we most certainly can. Science is by no means a bad thing if used in a godly, God-honoring way. And, like many other things, it can be used to bring glory to God (**1 Corinthians 10:31**). But science gets a lot of things wrong and cannot explain everything (far from it). 

Many people criticize religion because it conflicts with their worldview on how they think things came about. Yet little do they know that they are the religious one’s themselves caught up in a satanic system of manufactured theories designed to bring glory to the devil. A science that goes against the existence and purpose of God is nothing more than a religion in and of itself based on a terribly misguided agenda that serves the false "god.” Ultimately, there are only two religions in this world and they involve the worship of either the Creator or the Creature (**Romans 1:25**). It is understandable if people lambaste false religion (it is more Satan worship after all), but **biblical** Christianity that teaches salvation by grace through faith alone in Jesus Christ stands true. 

{{% scripture p="John 8:41-45 (ESV)" %}} 

**41** You are doing the works your father did." They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father—even God." **42** Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. **43** Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. **44** You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. **45** But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.

 We believers would do well to approach this topic from a spiritual/biblical viewpoint. When dealing with demonic activity, you cannot approach it with science because it is not something that science can explain.

Additionally, Mclean notes that such demonic possession, as described above, would cease when the victims would call upon the name of Jesus. In his book, he writes that “*The CE4 Research Group has recorded over 400 cases of individuals who were experiencing abductions and “alien” contacts only to have them ended by calling on the name of Jesus, and this group is by no means alone or unique.”* Why is that? Because demons are afraid of God; we know why that is. 

{{% scripture p="James 2:18-19 (ESV)" %}}

**18** But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. **19** You believe that God is one; you do well. **Even the demons believe—and shudder**!                              

{{% /scripture %}}  

There is, of course, no guarantee that all of the recorded instances documented actually happened. However, it is perfectly reasonable to believe that at least some (if not most) did occur. Even if those people who cried out to the Lord for help because of the suffering they were undergoing never got saved, I doubt it makes any difference. Just mentioning the name “Jesus” or “God,” in this writer's opinion, is enough to scare away satanic forces, regardless of whether the person had a salvation experience or not. Fallen angels are terrified of Jesus Christ!                                                    



## **4. My Encouragement and Exhortation to Believers**   

Back in 2014 (I began my paper in 2013 but finished the following year), I became discouraged with my lack of anything to speak of for cryptids and cryptozoology. My paper was a bust, and I had nothing to show anybody. I had nothing to educate anyone with and felt like I came away empty from the whole experience. But little did I know that the Lord would bring the subject back to my attention many years later. He would revive my enthusiasm and come to use it for His glory through this work I have written. We don’t have to believe everyone and everything, but we need to be respectful and treat others as we want others to treat us (**Luke 6:31**). Yes, there are indeed a lot of fakes, hoaxes and misidentifications. People make things up. But I would ask the reader to consider **everything** written in this study. 

We live in a world of many people who believe they know more about the earth than they do, including many believers, unfortunately. Scientists and intellectuals are treated as gods while all other people often get treated with less respect. Yet, as far as biblical/spiritual truth goes, it has nothing to do with intellect. It all has to do with the disposition of our hearts. Our Lord rewards those who diligently seek Him with the proper attitude under the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit. 

{{% scripture p="Hebrews 11:6 (NKJV)" %}}    

**6** But without faith *it is* impossible to please *Him,* for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and *that* He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.

There is so much we don’t know about our world. The funny thing is, most believers alive today don’t know hardly anything about the Bible they read on occasion, and that is saying a lot! So what makes anyone feel justified to write off what others have seen when they can’t prove otherwise? As our verse below states, we don’t believe everything immediately, but this also means we don’t write things off without sufficient knowledge. Our Lord created everything there is so that He would know more about the earth and universe than anyone! In this case, being wise isn’t believing or disbelieving a complex matter immediately but giving thought to the situation and approaching it with discernment, an approach that will require going to God for further clarity. 

Over the years, I have come to notice people being uncomfortable with things they do not understand. Nobody likes to face something that is beyond their comprehension because we human beings are just like that (even though much of that is inexcusable). We want to be in control and “in the know” of what lies around us (completely understandable), yet our knowledge of the world we live in is scanter than we want to believe. We are spiritual but also physical beings made of bone and water, given our capabilities by God. Without Him, we could do nothing (**John 15:5**). Firstly, we were not alive when our Savior created the original earth. We were not present when the angels dwelled on this planet along with the “original” flora and fauna. We were not present when Satan rebelled, and God blacked out the original earth. We were not there when He “refurbished” it and created new creatures. We were not there to witness the days of the Nephilim and the great flood (and the days after it). 

Scientific theories and methods are changing all the time; they have been for years. And as mentioned previously, science is going to do little good when dealing with spiritual issues. Much of this world is physical, yes, but much of it is spiritual. The angels (both fallen and elect) are a testimony to this. Spiritual battles are currently being fought all while we petty human beings sit around and quarrel about matters we don’t understand, nor can we without God’s aid. Let us go to Him first for answers and trust Him. And if we choose to do this, we must do so on His terms. People will fail us! Humans are fallible and prone to error. But God is perfect and all-knowing.

If people fall for what their eyes and ears see now, how much more will they do so when satanic activity will be the strongest it has ever been in human history during the tribulation? First, you have antichrist posing as “the Christ”( in addition to possibly being taken as extraterrestrial by others), and the false prophet performing false signs and miracles. Additionally, you will have all the potentially half-human, half-demonic world leaders who will control the world's many countries. There will be deception everywhere! The tribulation will be the worst time in human history, never to be equaled again! 

{{% scripture p="Mark 13:14-23 (NIV)" %}}   

**14** “When you see ‘the abomination that causes desolation’ standing where it does not belong—let the reader understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. **15** Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out. **16** Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. **17** How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! **18** Pray that this will not take place in winter, **19 because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now—and never to be equaled again**. **20** “**If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive**. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them. **21** At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it. **22** For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. **23** So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.

As believers, we walk by faith and not by sight (**2 Corinthians 5:7**). Therefore, let us stand firm and not be shaken by all that is around now and in the future. We know our purpose and mission on earth, so let us strive to give our best for the Lord. 

To close, I believe that Christians should not only expect the paranormal, but should see it for what it is; Satan’s modus operandi. I will clarify, however, that there is no pre-tribulation rapture and that the great apostasy does not occur until AFTER the tribulation begins. 

{{% scripture p="2 Thessalonians 2:1-4 (ESV)" %}}   

Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, **2** not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. **3** Let no one deceive you in any way. **For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction**, **4** who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, **proclaiming himself to be God**.

I also do not believe that UFOs and the paranormal will be the leading cause of the great apostasy by themselves. There will be multiple reasons for that, much of which will have to do with false teaching and deception. But the primary cause will result because of the lukewarm attitude of today’s believers who have chosen to put their desires before the truth of God’s Word. This mentality will leave many Christians unprepared for the great test known as the time of Jacob’s trouble (the tribulation). I have mentioned this passage at many points throughout this ministry, and I will repeat it here. The Lord will vomit believers out of His mouth for their indifference to His calling for their lives. 

Thus, the purpose of the apocalypse is twofold- to punish the unbelieving world for its wickedness and to discipline most of the church for being lukewarm. Thankfully, most believers will react accordingly to the circumstances during those dark days and willingly suffer for their Savior, who suffered so much for them! What a wonderful God we serve! 

{{% scripture p="Revelation 3:14-22 (NIV)" %}} 

**14** “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:

These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation. **15** I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! **16 So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth**. **17** You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. **18** I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see. **19** **Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.** **20 Here I am! I stand at the door and knock**. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. **21** To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne. **22** Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”

Demonic activity, in the form of UFOs, will most certainly contribute to the great deception and apostasy (to some degree) during the tribulation. Even now, believers are falling from the faith at an alarming rate. And some of that is no doubt due to the so-called “evidence” that there is no God (hence we have so many now caught up in atheism). Some have already proclaimed something like, “aliens are real, which proves God does not exist.” As soldiers in the army of the Lord Jesus, we must not fall for lies like these! We know the truth, and we know what we must do. 

{{% scripture p="Hebrews 10:23 (NIV)" %}}    

**23** Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.
