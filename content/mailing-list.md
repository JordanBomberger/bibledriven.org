title: Mailing List
---

The mailing list for BibleDriven will update followers of this ministry when new studies are posted on the website. Prayer requests and content from other recommended teaching ministries will also be passed along whenever I see it as beneficial to do so. 

As for mailing frequency, I cannot guarantee precisely when or how often I will send out news and updates. I will send out emails not only based upon on my own production rate, but also based on the number of prayer requests I want to pass along, as well as the number of other resources I have available to recommend.

Regardless, I won't spam you.
