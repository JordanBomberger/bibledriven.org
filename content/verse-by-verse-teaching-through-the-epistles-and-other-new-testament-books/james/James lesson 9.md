## Two Kinds of Wisdom 

{{% scripture p="James 3:13-18 (ESV)" %}} 

**13** Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. **14** But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. **15** This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. **16** For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. **17** But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. **18** And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

Some of the recipients of James’s letter deceived themselves because they thought they knew more than they did and were failing to apply the truth they accepted. So James responded to that notion with a question meant to get his readers to think and reevaluate themselves. As anyone should know, you cannot fix a problem unless you recognize it exists, as **Revelation 3:14-22** confirms all too well. One could even picture the Scribes and Pharisees claiming they could see when our Lord told them the opposite (**John 9:41**). Although James wrote to believers, they should have known better than to behave the way they did. 

The notion that wisdom can exist without application was a misconception that required correction through an extended explanation. Biblical wisdom is more than just knowing the right thing to do; it also involves doing it. Thus far, James has already covered this subject in-depth in his teaching on being doers of the Word and not just hearers (**James 1:22-25**), and in his teaching that faith without works is dead, as evidenced by two examples (**James 2:14-26**). The theme of seeking and applying wisdom begins at the start of the book and continues throughout to the end of chapter five. Many of the Jewish believers in this epistle reacted poorly to the difficult trials they faced; hence, James needed to command them to pray for wisdom (**James 1:5-8**), wisdom founded not only on correct knowledge but also on its application. How easy it is to do the right thing during times of ease, but to react differently when the pressure is on! 

Verses thirteen through eighteen and onwards form an additional appeal from James to get his readers to right their behavior by thinking, speaking, and acting according to the truth. Verses fourteen and sixteen help confirm that our previous section on the tongue primarily had the heart in mind, because foul and impure words all stem from the heart (**Matthew 15:19**). The tongue is simply a tool used by the heart to commit evil, as manifested in all the bad things we say. The heart is, of course, the interface between our human body and spirit that contains our values, emotions, and volition (including our free will, where we make our choices). The tongue, by itself, is not the driver behind evil, but a tool (like a physical hand used to strike another person) used to carry out what the heart desires and dictates. The first twelve verses of chapter three focused mainly on the outward manifestation of the sin problem (the “carrying out” process was formerly described in **James 1:13-15**), while verses fourteen and onward address more of the inward root cause (chapter four, beginning with verse one, delves into that even deeper). So, although the heart is involved in all sins of the tongue, nowhere do the first twelve verses of chapter three directly address or mention the heart or any of its inward, negative, attitudinal dispositions (ones we all choose to possess and give in to, of course).  

Why were some of James’s “congregants” running off at the mouth? There were multiple reasons that all stemmed from their inner desires (**James 4:1**), including “bitter jealousy” and “selfish ambition,” which we will examine and explain in the verses that follow (including in our next lesson in chapter four). For those who thought they were wiser than they were, James presented them with a challenge to prove it with works of righteousness because, as he had already laid down in chapter two, faith without works is dead! 

The opening word “*who*” is a challenge to those who failed to apply what James commands here (to “*show his works in the meekness of wisdom*”). However, to repeat what I’ve already said, not all these believers were failing to live properly because our verse presents more of an “if the shoe fits” type of scenario. Those living in obedience needed to continue doing so, while those erring on the opposite side needed to repent and reform their behavior. The Greek words for "wise" and "understanding" further confirm that James has both intellectual wisdom (knowledge of the truth) and practical wisdom (application of the truth) in mind, since both are necessary. The erring believer must first demonstrate a change of heart/mind/attitude (all the same thing in this case), confirmed by a change of action, lifestyle, or behavior (whatever word you want to pick). This process, known in the church as repentance, will lead the believer to continuously seek out the truth, which includes receiving the Word implanted by a trusted teaching source or sources (**James 1:21**), understanding it, believing it, and applying **it** (faith in action).  

As James has already confirmed in **James 2:19**, there are two senses to faith and/or belief. For example, you might mentally assert the following truth, “*Walk by the Spirit*, *and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh,*” and yet still fail to apply it when the pressure is on because you failed to fully **trust** in that very same truth you had stored in your heart earlier. Nodding the head in agreement to the truth is not a guarantee for fully trusting in it when the pressure is on, especially when we allow fear and doubt to override what we know to be true in our hearts. One could think of many examples, and the reader can most certainly recall various instances when this has occurred in their life (far too many to count, if we were to be honest with ourselves).  

True, biblical wisdom encompasses not only understanding the truth but also reflecting it in one’s lifestyle (the practical application side of the coin). The Greek word for “understanding” (“*who is wise and **understanding** among you*”) is *epistēmōn ἐπιστήμων*, referring to an intelligent and experienced person able to make sound judgments. Believing and applying the truth requires an understanding of it. The word for wisdom at the end of our verse is *sofos σοφός* and refers to doing something skillfully (which, in this case, refers to the believer applying the truth in their life). Knowing the truth but doing nothing with it doesn’t benefit anyone, because both the knowing and the doing aspects of wisdom are inseparable. One’s conduct (“*by his good conduct let him show*”) refers to the individual’s behavior (proving their faith in action by what they do), and this lifestyle requires gentleness (mildness) in how one applies the truth (meekness is the idea). So, instead of boasting in one’s false appreciation, understanding, and application of the truth (explained in the next verse), the believer needs to walk humbly with the Lord because pride goes before a fall.

## **Verse 14** 

### **Bitter jealousy and selfish ambition**  

{{% scripture p="James 3:14 (ESV)" %}} 

**14** But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.

As mentioned in our previous verse, James focuses more on the inward cause of poor speech and behavior. The battle always starts in the mind/heart because we are what we think (our thoughts dictate our words and actions). The word “But” contrasts the positive qualities mentioned in verse thirteen by contrasting wise meekness with bitter jealousy and selfish ambition (verse fourteen). Meek wisdom (a mild and humble knowledge of the truth understood, believed, and applied) results in good works (a harvest of righteousness, as mentioned in verse eighteen). On the contrary, jealousy and selfish ambition (self-interest) only produce that which is vile. It's no coincidence that James mentioned this by putting it this way because, as he mentioned in verses ten through twelve, one cannot simultaneously produce good and bad fruit. We cannot be double-minded or two-faced in our thoughts, words, and actions.    

{{% scripture p="James 3:10-12 (ESV)" %}}    

**10** From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. **11** Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? **12** Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.                                           

{{% /scripture %}}     

Both jealousy and selfish ambition help explain some of the fighting and quarreling that occurred among some of the scattered assemblies. Curtis Omo rightly mentions (see link in resources below) that some of James's readers' bitter and selfish attitudes stemmed from their disdain and envy of those with the gift of teaching. In other words, those not gifted or unprepared were jealous of those who were and were only interested in gaining the leadership for self-aggrandizement (explaining the selfish ambition they harbored). These individuals were envious and wanted positions of authority for the wrong reasons. 

How true this has been in so many churches in the past up to the present, with church leaders clamoring for positions they are either unprepared for or don’t belong in. It is for this reason that James goes on to say that disorder and every vile practice will always exist as long as these types of attitudes and behaviors remain. Many churches have divided and gone into decline because good pastors are often replaced by bad ones who make many changes for the worse (usually through an over-dominating attitude stemming from legalism). This explains why many churches lose attendance and don’t usually recover at all or for an extended period. 

For the reasons given above, it would be unwise for such guilty and conceited individuals to boast about a false appreciation, understanding, and application of the truth. If we boast, it is in Christ and His truth (**Jeremiah 9:23-24** and **2 Corinthians 10:17**), not in lies or ourselves, especially if our understanding of our knowledge and abilities is delusional.  

## Verse 15 

### The "wisdom" from below 

{{% scripture p="James 3:15 (ESV)" %}}  

**15** This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.  

{{% /scripture %}}      

In chapter one, verses five through eight, James commanded his recipients to pray for the wisdom they needed to endure the difficult trials they faced. The wisdom referred to there is the exact opposite of the type referred to here in our present verse, because while one is godly, the other is worldly and satanic in every way. James already mentioned that every good and perfect gift comes from above (not below) from the Father of lights (**James 1:17**). Since that is the case, how could godly wisdom involve jealousy and selfishness? It doesn’t, and that is the point. James wanted his readers to know that the kind of wisdom they should have been praying for should not be confused with the type that comes from the Devil. The apostle (not one of the twelve but apostle with a small “a”) then contrasts the two in verse seventeen, where he will go on to list some critical spiritual virtues that contrast with the impure motives and deeds of the flesh. The idea is to show us what worldly wisdom looks like in comparison to the wisdom from above.  

The word "wisdom" in this context refers to the application of knowledge (stemming from sinful motives in this case). However, as the rest of our verse confirms, it is a satanic kind of wisdom that involves acting according to the desires and inclinations of the sinful nature (some more mentioned in the passages right below, none of which are meant to be comprehensive).  

{{% scripture p="Galatians 5:19-21 (NIV)" %}}   

**19** The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; **20** idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions **21** and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.

{{% scripture p="Colossians 3:5-10 (NIV)" %}}   

**5** Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. **6** Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. **7** You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. **8** But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. **9** Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices **10** and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.

{{% scripture p="1 John 2:15-17 (NIV)" %}}     

**15** Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. **16** For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. **17** The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.                                                                           

{{% /scripture %}}     

Our first word is earthly and would refer to that which is worldly or from below (worldly behavior that adheres to the world's standards). The word “unspiritual” refers to a “wisdom” lacking in the Holy Spirit’s guidance. A believer who acts unspiritual (like an unbeliever) in this case would be someone who behaves contrary to the Holy Spirit because the Spirit’s wisdom is from above. Instead of walking by the Spirit, they walk according to the flesh (**Galatians 5:16-26**). An unspiritual (natural) person is a fleshly (carnal) person whose human spirit is not attuned to God. It refers to an unbeliever in their natural human state (Curtis Omo). And regarding the believer again, anytime we sin and refuse to get right with the Lord, we remain out of fellowship with Christ until we repent and confess our sins. So, when our behavior mirrors the world’s, we are also acting unspiritual in the sense that we are living according to the flesh and are, therefore, out of fellowship with the Lord as a result. 

The final word in our verse is "demonic" and is just as it sounds: demonic behavior influenced by demonic forces. Naturally, the unbeliever is under the control and influence of the flesh, the Devil, and all his minions. The unregenerate have no power over sin and the said forces that foster it. However, even believers can fall under this same influence when they are not controlled by the Spirit, due to walking in the power of their flesh. Sadly, this was the case with many of James’s readers who acted “unspiritual.” 

## Verse 16 

### Jealousy and selfish ambition 

{{% scripture p="James 3:16 (ESV)" %}}

**16** For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.                                                                                 

{{% /scripture %}}      

The principle above applies not only to teachers (or those who want to be pastors) but also to all believers for various reasons (the entire congregation, including those disputing other issues). Some of the believing individuals James wrote to fought and quarreled to gain authority over the congregation for self-aggrandizement and to lord themselves over their hearers (something Scripture forbids those in leadership from doing, **1 Peter 5:1-4**). 

In our previous lesson, we examined some of the qualifications of a prospective pastor-teacher and red flags to look out for. It should be clear enough by now what would qualify or disqualify an individual. And Scripture tells us how to differentiate a servant of Christ from a wolf in sheep’s clothes attempting to sneak in under false pretenses (**Matthew 7:15-20**). Some lack proper judgment and discernment by allowing them into their midst (**Acts 20:29**).

But when it comes to well-meaning believers, even seemingly prepared and qualified individuals can later prove their unworthiness, either because of the congregation’s lack of discernment or because the red flags weren’t as apparent initially. It has been far from uncommon for many churches to select the wrong person, only for them to start ruining things down the road. That includes teaching things the congregation had no prior knowledge of and making harmful changes and negative judgments that undermine the assembly from within. So not everything can be anticipated, especially if the candidate hasn’t had enough time to prove themselves. Once they have, the members should “vote with their feet” if the teaching proves sound (truly worth its weight). The content, oral, written, or both, should speak for itself (as should the pastor’s lifestyle). And, of course, a church may have a few teachers with one of them being a “first among equals” who takes up the primary leading role. The others will teach on the side, like deputies for a sheriff (this doesn’t make them inferior in any way).

However, a “want to be” seen fighting or competing for the position among his peers proves himself either unprepared or not gifted for it. Such individuals should be avoided because, as our verse tells us, there will be disorder (chaos) and every vile practice wherever bitter jealousy and selfish ambition exist (a “me first” attitude). The Greek word for disorder refers to a state of confusion and instability. Unstable people competing for leadership positions only create unstable atmospheres. 

{{% scripture p="2 Corinthians 12:20-21 (ESV)" %}}      

**20** For I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish—that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder. **21** I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced.                                                      

{{% /scripture %}}    

The word “vile” refers to that which is morally worthless and wicked (wicked deeds, in this case). There is the action of committing a sin and its result, the evil “work” stemming from an impure heart. Nothing good comes from jealousy and selfishness, so much so that their ugly results vary widely. 

{{% scripture p="2 Corinthians 5:10 (NASB 1995)" %}}    

**10** For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad (vile or evil).                                                              

{{% /scripture %}}     

To be clear, not all jealousy is evil if it involves zeal according to knowledge (**John 2:17**, as opposed to zeal without it, **Romans 10:2**). There is such a thing as godly jealousy (**2 Corinthians 11:2**). But the jealousy referred to here is, for obvious reasons, evil in every way.  

{{% scripture p="Romans 13:13 (ESV)" %}}   

**13** Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy.

But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. **2** I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, **3** for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?

## **Verses 17 and 18**  

### The fruit and harvest of wisdom 

{{% scripture p="James 3:17-18 (ESV)" %}}     

**17** But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. **18** And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.                                                        

{{% /scripture %}}    

Alas, many of the Jewish recipients of our letter were instructed to pray for wisdom (**James 1:5-8**), a quality many of them seemed to lack. James now shows them what that type of godly wisdom from above looks like, because his readers weren’t getting it right (many of them were praying with impure motives and double minds, living according to the world’s standards, **James 4:3-8**). 

**James 3:17-18** contrasts worldly wisdom from below with godly wisdom from above, much as **Galatians 5:19-26** distinguishes the acts of the flesh from the fruits of the Spirit. The list James provides is in no way meant to be comprehensive, but it highlights some of the more critical spiritual qualities that the believer should possess. The word “But” indicates the contrasting comparison and sets in motion the transition from the previous verse to this one. The wisdom from above refers to godly wisdom, which involves believing, thinking, and behaving as God would want us to (a lifestyle based on the acceptance, belief, and application of the truth through the power of the Holy Spirit). 

**Verse seventeen** begins with the word “pure” and in the Greek (*hagnos*) refers to that which is holy. The wisdom from above is set apart, sacred, different, and distinct from that of Satan’s world system (it is clean and without defect). The believer who professes Christ must reflect that in their lifestyle (it is the complete opposite of how some of the Jewish believers in our context were behaving). Since God’s wisdom is the opposite of the Devil’s, we believers need to act differently from those outside the body. God’s chosen people, Israel (of which all believers are in the spiritual sense, since not all Israelites are of Israel, **Romans 9:6**), were set apart from the rest of the world to be God’s chosen and treasured possession (only the believer is truly set apart). God’s wisdom is different and, therefore, separate from the world’s, which stands in stark defiance to the truth. To live according to God’s wisdom is to produce righteousness (**James 3:18**), as opposed to the deeds of darkness (**Ephesians 5:11**), including “every vile practice.”  

The next word in our list is peaceable and would indicate a type of non-combative behavior stemming from a pure disposition of heart (a person who speaks and behaves with no “ill-will” because their motives are pure). These individuals are at peace with God, themselves, and others. They don’t have an “axe to grind,” so to speak. You then have the word gentle which would refer to gentleness or mildness of spirit toward others (a kind, considerate person). 

Godly wisdom is also open to reason (reasonable) in that it is willing to hear others out without constantly interrupting out of a desire to quarrel (**James 1:19** and **James 4:1**). Godly reasonableness was necessary for James’s readers to receive the Word implanted (**James 1:21**) because unteachable people are unreasonable people. 

You then have the phrase “full of mercy” (merciful). Since God is merciful toward us (he was merciful by dying for our sins), He expects us to be the same toward others. And a person full of good fruits would be someone “full of good deeds” toward others (which includes producing the fruits of the Spirit). Also mentioned in our list is the quality of impartiality, which means not showing partiality (something James warned his erring readers against in **James 2:1-13**). True godly wisdom also includes being sincere, which refers to being genuine in one’s thoughts, words, and actions (without pretense or hypocrisy). 

We then have **verse eighteen,** which reads, “*And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace*.” This was a critical point for James to make, considering the fights and quarrels he is about to address in the next verse in chapter four (and the vying for positions out of selfish ambition and bitter jealousy he just discussed). A spiritually peaceful atmosphere is productive and harmonious, one of the very critical conditions needed for a congregation (or any group or gathering of believers) to flourish. One cannot apply the wisdom from above unless they are a peacemaker themselves. Knowing is not enough; one must practice what they believe, which means living at peace with others through godly words and actions. Those who sow in peace (*eirēnē*) produce the beautiful results of said virtue, the righteousness of the Spirit-controlled life. So, instead of resulting in chaotic fights, quarrels, and selfish “competitions” that produce only disorder and every vile practice, peaceful action helps stifle such conflicts. That, in turn, creates a harvest of righteousness by fostering unity that grows, blossoms, and flourishes. And wherever there is true, biblical unity, there is every type of righteous, peaceful deed.
