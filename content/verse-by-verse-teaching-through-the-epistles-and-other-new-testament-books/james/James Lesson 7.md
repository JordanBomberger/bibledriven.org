## Faith without works is dead 

{{% scripture p="James 2:14-26 (ESV)" %}} 

**14** What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? **15** If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, **16** and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? **17** So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.**18** But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. **19** You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder! **20** Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? **21** Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? **22** You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; **23** and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. **24** You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. **25** And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? **26** For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.

### Can dead faith save? 

We will conclude chapter two by beginning a new, yet related, section that contains the popular and well-known teaching on faith without works, a controversial passage and a stumbling block for many over the years. The reality is that this portion of Scripture makes perfect sense and is quite simple. For those who accept the truth of the gospel by faith through grace alone, we know and understand what these verses are not saying. Unfortunately, many religious and works-based groups have consistently relied on this part of the book to support and promote their belief that salvation comes through faith and works. But as we shall soon see, that is not what James means in verse twenty-four. Works, in and of themselves, don’t save. But as explained in the paragraph right below, James needed to emphasize them for multiple reasons. 

{{% scripture p="Acts 16:31 (NIV)" %}} 

**31** They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”

**16** For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. **17** For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. **18** Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.

My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. **2** He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.

Verse fourteen carries on the previous line of thought from verses one to thirteen (while continuing the theme of seeking and applying wisdom during difficult trials that began at the beginning of the book). James will now further drive home his point that knowledge of the truth without application isn’t enough (**James 1:22-25**) by vividly demonstrating the importance and necessity of works (of faith) in the believer’s life. Was anyone still convinced, after reading his letter, that just hearing the Word (something some struggled to do, **James 1:21**) was sufficient? Think again! There was also the danger of antinomianism as a reaction to the truth that believers are under grace (**James 2:12-13**). Just because we aren’t saved by the works of the Law (any works in any sense of that word **Ephesians 2:8-9**) doesn’t mean works of some kind won’t exist in the believer’s life (they must for reasons given and explained further in this study). Freedom from the Law sets us free from the power of sin and death that said Law pronounced on those who tried to utilize it for salvation. However, freedom from the works of the Law entails slavery to Christ, which results in works of obedience that stem from faith. That is why our passage below says what it says without contradicting itself. 

{{% scripture p="Ephesians 2:8-10 (NKJV)" %}} 

**8** For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; *it is* the gift of God, **9** not of works, lest anyone should boast. **10** For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

Once again, as he often does and will continue to do, James refers to his readers as “brothers.” Some of the Jewish recipients of this letter believed that simple head knowledge, by itself, was good enough. Yet James is about to teach them an important principle that said approach is insufficient. What good is it to have faith without any evidence backing up its genuineness? To clarify, I will explain later how this refers to both believers out of fellowship with Christ (as some of our Jewish readers were) and unbelievers claiming a saving faith in the Lord they don’t possess. 

### **What is faith**? **Clearing up a few issues** 

However, before we proceed, I would like to address the topic of genuine saving faith and tackle a few other related issues to clarify any potential misunderstandings regarding the subject (this is to lay a good foundation for our examination of **James 2:14-26**). Firstly, a person receives salvation by believing in Jesus Christ (see the posted verses above). That is the gospel, plain and simple. No, this is not “easy-believism” because we should already understand that salvation is dependent on continuous faith and that saving faith will naturally produce at least some works of obedience in the believer’s life (works that bespeak a dedicated follower or disciple of the Lord). Faith needs to be built up to survive (**Jude 1:20-25**). Although salvation is all about faith, constant, continuous, and worsening sinful disobedience can contribute to apostasy by hardening the heart.  If the reader is not familiar with how sin-involved apostasy works (sin doesn’t always have to be involved, of course), then I recommend revisiting **James 1:14** Lesson 4. What we think, say, and do still matter, and that is what James has been communicating to his readers this whole time.   

True saving faith in Jesus Christ requires total and absolute trust in Him that He alone is sufficient to save (think of the trust we put in the chairs we sit on to hold us). It is not merely an intellectual acceptance of facts (even the demons believe and shudder, **James 2:19**) but involves complete trust while surrendering oneself to Christ (it’s a commitment). 

Repentance and faith are two sides of the same coin because believing in Christ is a natural response to repentance (repentance being a change of mind about God, sin, and oneself, resulting in a change of action, behavior, or lifestyle made possible through faith in Jesus). It is for this reason that Peter was able to say in **Acts 2:38,** “Repent” without mentioning believe, because believing and repenting are “intertwined” (Robert D. Luginbill). This truth stands in stark contrast to those who teach repentance as some extra step in the initial salvation process. Faith in Jesus Christ is all that is needed because no one would have believed unless they had a change of heart. We should also note that **Acts 16:31** mentions only believing and nothing about repentance for the same reason we have just given. There are no multiple steps involved in the salvation process.  

Also, it is not necessary to publicly or privately declare Jesus as Lord to be saved. That is a total misunderstanding of **Romans 10:8-10**. Confession is what one does with what one believes. All those who believe in Jesus Christ naturally accept Him as their Lord and Savior and will acknowledge Him before men if called upon to do so (**Matthew 10:32-33**). Those who fail to acknowledge this prove they were always unbelievers from the beginning or apostates who formerly believed but abandoned their faith under pressure. True faith in that kind of a scenario would demonstrate itself through the “work” of confession, thus proving its genuineness.  

However, we could well ask, “What about Peter when he denied the Lord three times, **Matthew 26:34**?” That was a momentary lapse in Peter’s faith, not a “once and for all decision,” which is what **Matthew 10:32-33** has in mind (assuming the one denying the Lord is an apostate). Assuming said individual is an apostate, those whom the Lord denies before the Father for disowning Him are those who have given up entirely for good. Peter never did that and, thus, never became an apostate because he immediately regretted his decision and repented not long after.  

Likewise, many believers may experience a period of decline before experiencing improvement. This doesn’t mean they became unbelievers while addicted to sin (they didn’t lose their salvation). It simply means they were out of fellowship with Christ (their faith was temporarily inactive) until they returned to Him, just as the prodigal son did (**Luke 15:11-32**). But for those who refuse to get right with the Lord, apostasy (the complete abandonment of faith resulting in eternal death) or physical death as a form of divine discipline for wayward believers clinging to sin while still holding onto their faith are the only two other possible outcomes. Ultimately, salvation is not about what we do, but about faith in Christ, as proven by what He produces in us when we walk with Him in faith. 

Another false theological construct (in addition to the view that repentance is some extra step required for salvation when it is “intertwined” with faith) is this idea (often promoted by those who reject free will) that faith is a work. Therefore, according to them, God’s sovereignty overrules man’s ability to choose for Him because salvation is not by works (even though faith is not a work). Hence, this position argues that all believers are guaranteed to remain faithful and that all those who fall away were never truly saved to begin with. Although there are many professing Christians (false brethren) out there who never trusted in Christ at all (going to church doesn’t make one a believer) and walk away from church, there are plenty of former believers (people who were saved at one point) who fall away (a principle truth verified by the parable of the sower in **Luke 8:4-15** and explained elsewhere in the other synoptic gospels). 

Additionally, **1 Corinthians 15:2** proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that salvation depends on continuous and lasting faith. There would be no point in **Hebrews 3:12** and so many other passages throughout Scripture warning us to guard and protect our faith if anyone could not apostatize. You can’t fall away from a faith you never had (**Matthew 24:10-13**), a point overlooked by those who wish to overemphasize the sovereignty of God to the detriment of free will. **Ephesians 2:8-9** and **Titus 3:5-7** clearly show that faith and works are two different things, so that trying to read these verses any other way results in the false conclusion mentioned in the first sentence in the last paragraph above. Based on the passages just referenced, Scripture is clear that we must build up, guard, and hold fast to our faith till death. The problem this creates for some is that they believe this is a gospel of “self-effort” (since the believer must build up their faith and hold fast to it). 

The problem with the objection in the last sentence above is that the Bible never states faith is a work or that holding fast to it by continuing to follow our faithful Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is “self-effort” (the burden of proof lies with those who claim it is). We must then ask, “What does **Titus 3:5** mean when it says, “*He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy*” or **Ephesians 2:8**b, which reads, “*It is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God*?” It simply means that we cannot earn our salvation through works in any sense of that word, and that it was by Christ’s sacrificial death on the cross that enabled our salvation. We did not and could not pay for our own sins, and salvation was never something the Lord had to grant us as if he owed us anything. It was dependent on God’s choice, grace, and mercy to choose to die for humanity (this sacrificial death on the cross was not something we accomplished). 

The other meaning of this is that no amount of human good works, abstaining from sinful behavior, works of the Law, or works of faith (to be explained later) can earn us God’s favor. This is exactly what Scripture means when it mentions that salvation is not something we accomplish through good works in our own strength. Nowhere in the Bible does it ever reference faith as any of those types of works. If holding fast to faith were us working our way to Heaven through our own strength (something it clearly isn’t), then believing in Jesus (**Acts 16:31**, **John 3:16**) must also be us earning our salvation since faith requires us to do something (choosing to believe in Jesus Christ). However, that assumption is flawed theology because it is entirely divorced from Scripture, as the Bible contains no such teaching (the teaching being that initial and continuous faith in Christ is working for salvation).

**25** When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” **26** Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. **27** Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” **28** Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” **29** Jesus answered, “**The work of God is this**: **to believe in the one he has sent**.”

The bolded phrase in the last sentence in the passage above demonstrates that faith is not a work in the negative sense that Scripture gives when it mentions salvation not coming from ourselves (“*neither is there salvation in any other*” **Acts 4:12**). Our Lord only phrased it that way to contrast the true way of salvation as opposed to a system dependent on works, the kind of gospel the Pharisees had fed the Jewish people (a gospel that taught strict adherence to the Mosaic Law). Since these Jews were so hung up on the word “works,” it was easier for our Lord to use the word “work” as an exaggeration to tell the people, “Here is what you must do to be saved.”  

Once again, **Ephesians 2:8-9** (as well as **James 2:14-26**) is clear that faith and works are two distinctly different things. Christ saved us by dying on the cross to pay for our sins (**1 Corinthians 15:3-8**), thus opening the way to eternal life. We receive this offer by choosing to believe in Jesus. When we do so, it is through Christ’s strength that we become saved, because initial and progressive sanctification are all God’s work, work we participate in through faith. God is the worker who saves us, while we are the beneficiaries who (by free will faith) allow Him to work in us to accomplish His will.  

{{% scripture p="2 Timothy 4:14-18 (ESV)" %}} 

**14** Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. **15** Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message. **16** At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be charged against them! **17** But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth. **18** The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed **and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom**. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.                                                                       

{{% /scripture %}}    

With all these things in mind, the works **James 2:14-26** mentions (**not** the works of the Mosaic Law) are works of faith (results of salvation produced through genuine saving faith) accomplished through spiritual growth (living obedient lives by resisting sin and applying the truth of God’s Word in general), progress (passing the more difficult tests of our faith that come to the spiritually mature), and production (bringing forth fruit in our service to others within and outside the church through the use of our spiritual gifts in the ministries we’ve all been called to). This stands in stark contrast to religious “do-goodism,” which seeks to earn eternal life by what one does (whatever false religion or group comes to mind). 

Considering all this, how do we explain the bolded phrases in the two passages below?  

{{% scripture p="Romans 2:6-11 (NIV)" %}} 

**6** God “**will repay each person according to what they have done**.” **7** To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. **8** But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. **9** There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; **10** but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. **11** For God does not show favoritism.

{{% scripture p="Revelation 20:11-15 (ESV)" %}} 

**11** Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. **12** And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, **according to what they had done**. **13** And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. **14** Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. **15** And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.                                        

{{% /scripture %}}    

On the surface, **Romans 2:6-11** appears to suggest that eternal life or death depend on what we do, rather than accepting what Christ did for us and holding fast to that choice. However, these verses affirm what **James 2:14-26** proclaims: faith without works is dead. Everyone is judged for salvation based on whether they accepted or rejected Christ’s solution to the problem of sin and death (the sins of humanity have all been paid for by Christ’s death on the cross, **Romans 5:8**). However, what a person does indicates whether they have saving faith or not. 

For believers, the Bema seat of Christ will not be to decide our salvation since that was already determined. Instead, it will be a spiritual evaluation for dispensing eternal rewards (**1 Corinthians 3:10-15**). However, although this is true, the good works believers accomplish in this life also prove they have saving faith and are, therefore, worthy of eternal life, because salvation is by grace through faith alone (faith without works is dead). A believer is someone who demonstrates saving faith in Christ by producing works of faith through Christ’s strength, and that is a key point. A believer’s faith is evidenced in their complete faith and trust in Christ through their belief and acknowledgement that all good things they do in life are a result of their salvation and a work of the Spirit. A believer is someone who believes in Christ, not themselves, because they understand that all the good things they do are things they did in Christ’s strength alongside faith (**James 2:22**). 

To sum up the believer’s judgment “*according to what they had done*,” this refers to 1) their spiritual evaluation for eternal rewards 2) their works of faith proving their salvation and the power of God in their lives to produce them, and 3) their true faith and trust in Christ evidenced by the fact that all good they did they accomplished through His power, once again confirming they had genuine saving faith instead of a “works-based” approach to salvation (they trusted in Christ instead of themselves). Whatever good the believer does in faith through God’s strength, with a pure heart and good motives, will be rewarded. In that case, such goods deeds were good because they were done in faith, and whatever is truly done in faith is always carried out through Christ’s strength for His glory. However, whatever any one of us does absent walking in fellowship with Christ, with impure motives without faith, will not be rewarded (such works will be burnt up). 

The unbeliever, on the other hand, demonstrates their lack of saving faith in Jesus Christ by failing to produce anything good for Him because they did nothing in faith. No unbeliever can accomplish anything good for God because they have no saving faith and, therefore, no good works to demonstrate it. The good works of the unbeliever are the exact opposite of those of the believer because faith and genuine good works (in God’s eyes) go hand in hand. No saving faith equals no works, and a lack of works demonstrates a dead faith, which will not only result in no eternal rewards but also no eternal life.

To sum up the unbeliever’s judgment “*according to what they had done*,” this refers to 1) the unbeliever’s eternal condemnation because of a lack of saving faith (they are condemned for failure to accept Jesus Christ) proven by the complete absence of any genuine good works in their life, and 2) the unbeliever’s condemnation because of substituting Christ’s work on the cross for their own human good works accomplished in their power, for their own purpose, instead of for God.

**31** “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. **32** All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. **33** He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. **34** “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. **35** For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, **36** I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’ **37** “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? **38** When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? **39** When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’ **40** “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ **41** “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. **42** For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, **43** I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’ **44** “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’ **45** “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ **46** “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”

### **Finishing verse 14** 

James ends verse fourteen with the words, “*Can that faith save him*?” A faith that has nothing to show for itself can only be said to be dead, a “demon-faith” as possessed by an unbeliever who merely accepts the existence of God and only intellectually appreciates His Son’s work on the cross. This verse specifically refers to unbelievers, and James presents the matter in this way to encourage his readers to repent by highlighting the fact that they were acting just as badly as unbelievers to get them to stop sinning (see the explanation for **James 2:13** in our previous lesson). He wasn’t trying to scare them but to turn them around by pointing out the seriousness of their behavior. It is for this reason that he will reference a hypothetical scenario involving two brothers in Christ to illustrate that such conduct mirrors that of an unregenerate person (verse fifteen). A faith with nothing to show for it demonstrates a life without Christ, proving these individuals to be unbelievers whose simple mental assertion of God’s existence (demon faith) is insufficient to get them into Heaven. But saving faith is a commitment that involves complete trust in Jesus.  

## **Verses 15 through 17** 

{{% scripture p="James 2:15-17 (ESV)" %}} 

**15** If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, **16** and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? **17** So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

### An example of dead faith 

We need to remember that James is writing to believers, so that the sentence “*So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead*” applies not only to unbelievers but also to believers. There would be no point for James to mention any of this if these words did not also hold significance for his Jewish recipients. The context, purpose, and theme of the book indicate that these believers were struggling to apply what they had learned **(James 1:22-25)**, and even receiving the Word was a struggle for them **(James 1:21**). 

But before we further elaborate on that, we notice James’s use of a hypothetical scenario to express his point, an approach he utilized earlier in verses one to four of our chapter, with the example of the differing treatment of the rich and the poor. In those verses, that hypothetical scenario was based on actual issues that existed among the Jewish brethren. They were discriminating against the poor, despite being poor themselves! Now, James employs another hypothetical example, but one that remains relevant to the actual struggles taking place in the church. Many of these Jewish believers weren’t applying the truth, and one of the ways they did so (as the text seems to suggest) was through their negligence of the orphans and widows in their midst (**James 1:27**). 

It has been said that “Not helping is the same as hurting” (most certainly true if there is a legitimate and desperate need where the obligation to help is mandatory and not optional; an emergency situation). What good is it to do nothing about an obvious problem? Our verses involve a brother or sister in Christ (although including stumbling upon an unbeliever in desperate need could be included and wouldn’t change the meaning of these words) in desperate need of physical necessities (food and clothing). 

However, before we conclude our hypothetical illustration, we need to understand something first. First and foremost (an obvious fact, as we’ve already seen), the works of faith James references here do not save (salvation is by faith through grace alone). So if works must be present, how is it they don’t contribute to the process if they have no salvivic implications? The answer is that all believers (those possessing genuine saving faith in Jesus Christ) will naturally produce at least a few good deeds throughout their lifetime because everyone who enters God’s kingdom (those who die with faith intact) will have something to show for their time on earth. After all, it is impossible not to have produced at least something during one’s life because even just one good deed done in Christ’s power for His glory will not fail to receive its reward (as the passage below clearly demonstrates). If that’s all it takes (the very least of what is needed to prove that said faith wasn’t suspect), then there can be no possibility any Christian can live out their entire life (however much time God has set for them) without having done anything at all.  

{{% scripture p="Matthew 10:40-42 (NASB 1995)" %}} 

**40** “He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me. **41** He who receives a prophet in *the* name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward. **42** And whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink, **truly I say to you**, **he shall not lose his reward**.”

And every believer’s rate of production will vary (**Mark 4:20**). Some will have very little to show for their time on earth (a likely fitting description for most believers that have lived up to our present time, including those alive today **Mark 4:19**) but will still be blessed with eternal life and just as happy as any believer. 

To summarize and conclude our examination of verses fifteen through seventeen, this hypothetical scenario may remind us of the parable of the good Samaritan referenced in our last lesson (see **Luke 10:25-37**), and that is no coincidence because **James 2:8** also mentions loving our neighbor as ourselves (the royal law of love). Anytime we sin or refuse to act in love is a wasted opportunity that could have resulted in a good work and, therefore, an eternal reward (**Matthew 10:42**).

With that said, we again need to remember that James is speaking to believers. Once again, he mentions the truth that a saving faith produces and that a dead faith cannot save because it has nothing to back up its claimed legitimacy. James’s readers were believers, so he was not trying to scare them by presenting things in this way, but rather to sober them up and help steer them back in the right direction, encouraging them to walk in faith. He wanted to remind them that their current spiritual approach reflected that of unbelievers to help them remember their true spiritual identity and standing with Christ (that is not who they are!). Since these are believers, the teaching that faith without works is dead has a dual meaning (the first we have already discussed and will revisit in verses eighteen and nineteen). 

The second meaning of having a “dead faith” refers to a believer being out of fellowship with Christ due to sinful disobedience, as they are not walking in the Spirit (**Galatians 5:16-18**). Whenever we sin, whether it be the occasional slip-up or some nasty pattern we’ve gotten into, this puts us out of fellowship with Christ until we acknowledge our sins to Him (**1 John 1:9**). When we are out of fellowship with the Lord, our faith is momentarily inactive and, in that sense, dead because we are no longer walking in faith through Christ’s power (said person would then be under the control of the fleshly sin nature). You could think of a light switch turned off, rather than on. No one is perfect, so we will all continue to have our “dead faith moments” when we are temporarily and briefly out of fellowship with Christ (no one is without sin **1 John 1:8**). However, the longer we take to confess and the more we dally in sin, the longer we will continue to grope about. That is why it is so critical to confess our sins as quickly as possible while learning to put said mistakes behind us (while clinging to a resolve to do better in fighting our battles as we advance).

### Active faith versus dead faith 

James now challenges his readers to rethink and reorient their approach to the Christian life by again reminding them of the dangers and utter futility of not walking in faith (being doers of the Word by applying the truth). There is a difference between claiming faith (an unbeliever) and possessing it (a believer) but not walking in it. The recipients of this letter were Jewish believers, so they had saving faith. But many of them weren’t living by the Spirit’s power to produce spiritual fruit and the works of righteousness displayed by His indwelling presence. James was aware that this didn’t make for a good testimony and tried to sober up his readers by presenting them with a possible dilemma that could arise if someone happened to observe and inquire about their “faith.” If some of them (not all but only those to whom it applied; these words apply to us today) continued to act like unbelievers, others within the church could reasonably question their salvation or relationship with the Lord. This hypothetical statement in verse eighteen applies to both believers who are not in fellowship with Christ and to unbelievers who claim saving faith they don’t possess.  

And this is why the believers in our context needed to be careful how they walked (**Ephesians 5:10-17**) because their behavior paralleled that of unbelievers. If they were truly walking in faith and, therefore, in fellowship with the Lord, then there would be positive signs backing up said claims. No or few works? Then, either that person is out of fellowship with Christ or is not a true believer. What happens if others put these types of people on the spotlight? How will they answer for themselves? What proof will they give?    

{{% scripture p="John 15:5-8 (NIV)" %}} 

**5** “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. **6** If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. **7** If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. **8** This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, **showing yourselves to be my disciples**.                          

{{% /scripture %}}    

Verse eighteen should not be seen as “guilt-tripping” or as some “gotcha,” but as conviction through the truth. A carnal believer may talk a good talk but will demonstrate their inability to claim a growing walk with their Lord by lacking any signs to confirm it. Asking someone to show their faith without proof of either its existence or activity will indeed prove a dead faith (inactive for a believer or entirely dead for an unbeliever). 

The imaginary person asking the question, on the other hand, would show an active or living faith by manifesting its presence through obedience. That is why verse twenty, which follows, says, *“Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?”* (which James will do because that verse leads to his discourse on the example of Abraham and Rahab the prostitute). A believer’s inactive faith is useless because 1) it renders them spiritually ineffective for Christ for the spiritual service of others while giving off a poor testimony, potentially influencing them for the worst, 2) it hinders their spiritual growth by damaging their faith and threatening their salvation, and 3) results in no eternal rewards. For the unbeliever, the point should be evident that no saving faith is useless, because it can’t save them (**James 2:14**), resulting in eternal death, despite whatever they may claim. 

It is very common to see many unbelievers mention how much their faith means to them. They claim to have it and stress the importance of it in their lives while not living it out because of unbelief and because they don’t understand what genuine saving faith in Christ is (for more information on that, I encourage the reader to read the beginning section of this lesson in case they haven’t already done so). For many, faith is merely believing in the existence of God and mentally asserting all the facts about the person and work of Christ (“*You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder*!”). This statement, taken from verse nineteen, shows us that James has both believers and unbelievers in mind. For believers, an inactive faith is dead and, therefore, useless for spiritual growth, progress, and production. For the unbeliever, a mental assertion and appreciation of facts are worthless because they don’t make one a believer destined for eternal life. 

Works-oriented people (especially many in false religions such as Catholicism and others) twist this entire passage to mean that the works themselves save. The thinking goes that if works “work” alongside faith (**James 2:22**), then they too must also have salvific implications. But James’s point is that works demonstrate a saving faith and, in that sense, they justify a person by proving the legitimacy of their salvation because at least some works have to be present for someone to be said to be a believer (just as how no one who remains a believer till death can go on sinning as an idolater for the rest of their lives **1 John 5:18** because it isn’t possible for faith to survive once a person has fully surrendered themselves to sin).

The problem with religious unbelievers (the hypocritical Scribes and Pharisees of Christ’s day also undoubtedly come to mind) who seek to earn God’s favor by what they do (instead of trusting in what He did for them) is that they equate the works as having some magical saving power when it is the grace of God coupled with faith that saves us (**Hebrews 4:1-2**). And heaven forbid if (according to the logic of these “do-gooders”) one fails in certain areas (not being a member of and/or attending a specific church, participating in various unbiblical rituals, and committing specific sins) that they should retain their salvation (sarcasm intended). Some teach that committing certain sins is enough for salvation to be lost (mortal vs venial sins in the Catholic Church, as an example). However, this is easily refuted by **John 3:16**, **Acts 16:31**, and **1 John 2:1-2**, to name a few examples. There is also the false idea that one must be a member of a particular church, denomination, or group to be saved. But **Acts 4:12** easily lays that issue to rest. One could go on debunking all the unbiblical rituals and “add-ons” to the gospel that false religion has promoted since the beginning of human history (the example of Cain versus Abel is among the earliest that comes to mind, **Genesis 4**). 

It is utter folly to think that Christ’s work of redemption is not enough and that we must do something else to attain eternal life. But that is not saving faith because it isn’t **complete** faith and trust in Christ at all! Whatever works said person claims to do for God doesn’t count because they were done without faith in Christ. Such people possess zeal without knowledge. And it makes no difference in the “types” of works in question. There are no works that, by themselves and in themselves, can save anyone (whether those be the works of faith described in our context or the works of the Law). If the present-day church were still under the Law (we obviously aren’t), then obedience to it (though not necessary for salvation during Old Testament times, because works of any kind are incapable of saving anyone) would indicate a saving faith. But never did the works hold any salvific power. 

{{% scripture p="Romans 10:1-13 (NIV)" %}}  

Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. **2 For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God**, **but their zeal is not based on knowledge**. **3 Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own**, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. **4** Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. **5** Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.” **6** But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) **7** “or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). **8** But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: **9** If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. **10** For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. **11** As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” **12** For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, **13** for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”

As many scholars and pastors have pointed out, there are no quotation marks in the original Greek for the hypothetical statement James uses as an example in verse eighteen. The question of “where does the example stop” has arisen because it may be unclear whether the sentence in verse nineteen, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder,” is from James or the imaginary speaker. But regardless of which it is, it doesn’t change the meaning of the verses in any way. Again, we must remember that our text addresses both believers and unbelievers. The unbelievers who claim faith but can’t back it up with any proof need to know that even demons (allies of the Devil and enemies of God) possess that kind of faith. Yet, it means nothing because their “faith” cannot save for reasons already given. The believer(s) reading these words need to understand that by walking in the flesh, they are out of fellowship with Christ and acting like those unbelievers who claim a saving faith they don’t have. 

For us today, the more we pursue spiritual growth by walking in the Spirit, the more “fruit” we will produce. And it is these kinds of “works” that indicate His presence in our lives, the works of spiritual growth (including resisting sin), progress in bearing up under the difficult tests that come our way (**James 1:1-12**), and production in using our spiritual gifts in the ministries God has called us to. 

{{% scripture p="Galatians 5:16-26 (ESV)" %}}  

**16** But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. **17** For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. **18** But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. **19** Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, **20** idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, **21** envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. **22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, **23** gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. **24** And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. **25** If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. **26** Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.

To swing back to verse twenty, these are James’s words to his fellow brothers and sisters because of what follows in verse twenty-one.  The writer begins to demonstrate, through a couple of examples, how and why faith without works is dead or useless, as he needed to do so (for both the direct recipients of this epistle and for all believers afterwards up to our present time). 

Verse twenty may seem a bit harsh with the words “foolish person,” but should not be taken as some personal insult meant to inflict harm. The writers of Scripture sometimes employed strong language to convince their hearers that what they were thinking, believing, or doing was ridiculous, prompting them to repent and turn around (or to simply change their thinking and beliefs, depending on the situation). So, if the actions were there (if the shoe fit), then said person was acting “empty,” foolish, or unwise. It does not mean that the individual, outside of these thoughts and behaviors, was foolish without reason or cause. The Greek word for foolish in verse twenty is (*κενός*) *kenos* and means empty, empty-handed, and even “devoid of the truth.” Those Jewish individuals who thought hearing without application was sufficient were, though still believers, lacking in the truth, as they either didn’t know that works were essential or did, but refused to apply what they knew (both possibilities are possible depending on the individuals in question). Either way, one can be devoid of the truth in either beliefs, lifestyle (no application), or both. And the principle James laid out in these verses is one his readers should have known! 

However, **flexibility is key here**. The words “faith without works,” as we know, apply not only to believers but to unbelievers. Unbelievers are devoid of the truth entirely because they are unsaved, while believers can be devoid of it in the sense of ignorance and/or failure to practice what they know. 

Finally, I would like to mention one last point before wrapping up verse twenty by briefly pointing our attention back to verse fourteen. The verse reads, “*What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? **Can that faith save him***?” Indeed, no faith equals no salvation, so that a mere acceptance and acknowledgement of facts (God exists as one) isn’t sufficient for salvation. 

At first glance, it may appear that these words only apply to the unbeliever. Now, I have mentioned that James put things this way to convict his readers by reminding them that they were acting just as badly as unbelievers, to get them to repent and start applying the truth. However, it is also essential to state that these words can also apply to the believer, in that any Christian who thinks they can drift away from God (and their lifestyle shows it as they begin to produce fewer works) by doing whatever they want is in danger of apostasy (these words were meant from James as a type of appeal for the believer to stick to the narrow road of salvation **Matthew 7:13-14**). And if said result were to reach maturity (**James 1:14-15**), then the person’s faith could no longer save them if they stop believing altogether. Sin does not have to be involved. But when it is, it indirectly contributes to the death of faith by hardening the heart, forcing the individual to make a choice either for or against God. If they abandon Him altogether, their lack of any good works will prove a dead and, thus, unproductive faith devoid of spiritual fruit. 

There was a potential danger for some of these believers that if they continued to fail to apply the truth, their faith could slip away altogether. They deceived themselves by thinking that hearing was enough. Therefore, the result of such thinking could lead to apostasy if taken too far, where those involved would claim a faith that couldn’t save them because it would have disappeared entirely.

Faith (complete trust in Jesus Christ) is all it takes to be saved, so that if that faith is genuine, it will become evident by how one lives. {{% /note %}} 

There were, for example, undoubtedly a handful of Jews in Jerusalem who had fallen entirely back into Judaism, never to return despite Paul’s efforts to turn them back through the letter of Hebrews. These individuals thought they were pleasing God by embracing the true Gospel, but they had actually fallen back on the Law for salvation. They claimed faith, but their lack of good works (exchanged for blasphemous ones that declared a Messiah not yet come through their continued practice of animal sacrifice) proved they no longer believed. Paul attempted to prevent as many Jerusalem believers as he could from turning back. However, despite his efforts, some had. These would be those who thought their “faith” could save them. In reality, they deluded themselves because they had zeal without knowledge (**Romans 10:1-4**).  

I highly recommend the reader to visit the following link for a good chapter-by-chapter study through the book of Hebrews by Dr. Robert D. Luginbill (a book that came right before the one we are now studying and helped to inspire James to write this epistle that bears his name), where these issues are discussed at greater length.

## **Verses 21 through 23** 

{{% scripture p="James 2:21-23 (ESV)" %}}  

**21** Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? **22** You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; **23** and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God.                  

{{% /scripture %}}     

### The Example of Abraham 

James now delves into his first example to illustrate the principle that faith must accompany works. Verse twenty-two helps to explain verse twenty-one by showing how faith and works “work” together in salvation. Since faith can’t be real without works (there is no such thing as saving faith absent anything to show for it), then, in that sense, works save by proving said faith. James did not mean that the works themselves save, but that they indicate salvation. 

The word “justified” is *δικαιόω* *dikaioó* and means to be declared righteous. If the reader recalls, Abraham was saved long before he offered his son Isaac on the altar, as the passage below confirms (if not far earlier as **Hebrews 11** may suggest). Therefore, this, perhaps the greatest test of his life, was not him getting saved a second time (it was not a “justification moment”), but an act of obedience that **declared** and “**advertised**” His faith (proving without a shadow of a doubt that his works demonstrated His righteous standing with God and that they were not salvific in and of themselves). 

{{% scripture p="Genesis 15:1-6 (NIV)" %}}   

After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.” **2** But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” **3** And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.” **4** Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.” **5** He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”**6 Abram believed the** **Lord**, **and he credited it to him as righteousness**.     

{{% /scripture %}}     

Therefore, his works evidenced his active saving faith, further declaring not only that he was a believer but that he was walking in close fellowship with the Lord (an area some of James’s recipients needed to improve in). That is the meaning of the phrase, “*Faith was active along with his works*.” Works completed his faith in that they proved that he followed through entirely in complete trust and, therefore, obedience to God’s commands. If obedience is lacking, how can we really say we had faith if there was nothing to prove we exercised it? **Hebrews 11** contains no small (though far from comprehensive) list of many great believers of the past who all walked and died in faith. And, yes, Abraham is on that list!  

{{% scripture p="Hebrews 11:8-19 (NIV)" %}}   

**8** By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. **9** By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. **10** For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. **11** And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise. **12** And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.**13** All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. **14** People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. **15** If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. **16** Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.**17** By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, **18** even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.” **19** Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.                            

{{% /scripture %}}      

Verse twenty-three is a quotation from **Genesis 15:6**. **Genesis 22:1-19** fulfills what Abraham had already done in **Genesis 15**, as it demonstrated the faith he had up to that point. Abraham was already a believer (having been one for many years) and the act of sacrificing his son (the substitute ram was a prefiguration of Christ’s future death on the cross) fulfilled the truth already revealed in **Genesis 15**. 

In what sense was Abraham a “friend” of God? We can think of **Exodus 33:11**, where Moses spoke to God face-to-face as one speaks to a friend. All believers are friends of God because we have chosen His side over that of Satan’s and the world’s. No, this is not your typical friendship where those involved are equals (we are not equal to God in the ultimate sense). There are significant differences in authority and how we approach the Lord in reverent fear (**Philippians 2:12**). One could go on to list many more differences. So, this is not a friendship in all the same ways as a human friendship (although there are some parallels). The believer is a friend of God because they belong to Him as those who seek to please and obey Him. How do we grow closer to our ultimate friend? By growing spiritually by seeking out the truth, understanding it, believing it, and applying it (being doers of the Word). This entails loving the Lord with all our strength (**Matthew 22:36-40**), manifested through our love for all people (**James 2:8**). In essence, it means obeying Christ and growing closer to Him day by day.

## Verses 24 and 25

{{% scripture p="James 2:14-26 (ESV)" %}}   

**24** You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. **25** And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? **26** For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead                                                               

{{% /scripture %}}    

### The example of Rahab  

As we should already know, **verse twenty-four** does not contradict Paul’s words in **Ephesians 2:8-9** (or any other part of Scripture). If salvation is not from us, not according to works, then how do we reconcile Paul’s teaching with this passage? Firstly, James is discussing works of faith (examined and explained above), not the works of the Mosaic Law that Paul criticized many for relying on for salvation. But neither has any salvific implications. 

However, since genuine saving faith must always accompany at least some good works to demonstrate its true nature, then works must still be present for the individual to be declared or considered righteous. Abraham’s act of obeying the Lord to sacrifice his son declared (advertised) his faith to be real; obedience proves one as a child of God (that one act did not justify Abraham because he became a believer many years prior). Since saving faith must entail obedience to some level, then, in that sense, works “work” alongside faith in salvation (**James 2:22**, **Philippians 2:12**). It is in this sense that a person “*is justified by works and not by faith alone*” because a saving faith cannot exist without anything to prove it (the works themselves don’t save because salvation is still by faith through grace alone). Abraham was saved the moment he first got saved (in the same manner all believers are today) as soon as he put his complete faith and trust in God. That is what entered him into God’s family, while works would follow not long afterward. 

**Verse** **twenty-five** now presents us with another example to illustrate the same principle James has already laid out. This case involves Rahab the prostitute, and it is necessary to revisit that passage in its context to better understand how her case relates to our examination. 

{{% scripture p="Joshua 2:1-11 (NIV)" %}}   

Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. “Go, look over the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there. **2** The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.” **3** So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.” **4** But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from. **5** At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I don’t know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.” **6** (But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.) **7** So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.**8** Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof **9** and said to them, “I know that the Lord has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you. **10** We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed. **11** When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.

**12** “Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign **13** that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them—and that you will save us from death.” **14** “Our lives for your lives!” the men assured her. “If you don’t tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land.” **15** So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall. **16** She said to them, “Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way.”**17** Now the men had said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us **18** unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house. **19** If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads; we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house with you, their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them. **20** But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.” **21** “Agreed,” she replied. “Let it be as you say.” So she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.**22** When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them. **23** Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them. **24** They said to Joshua, “The Lord has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us.”

Firstly, we should note that Rahab’s example reinforces the truth that men and women are equal in God’s eyes (one in Christ Jesus, **Galatians 3:28**) and that salvation is available to all and attained by all in the same way: by faith alone. There have also been many great female heroes of the faith throughout church history just as there have been men (Rahab also appears as an example of faith in **Hebrews 11:31** and see also **Matthew 1:5**). But this verse also shows that a person’s past, no matter how bad, cannot and should not keep them from receiving the Lord’s grace. God does not hold our failures against us (including all the sins we commit as believers) but has thrown them behind His back. Rahab was a good example of someone who loved much because she had been forgiven much. And she proved this by demonstrating extreme fear and gratitude towards God by putting her own life at risk to save two of her fellow siblings in Christ.  

{{% scripture p="Luke 7:36-50 (ESV)" %}}   

**36** One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at table. **37** And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, **38** and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment. **39** Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.” **40** And Jesus answering said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he answered, “Say it, Teacher.” **41** “A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. **42** When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?” **43** Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.” And he said to him, “You have judged rightly.” **44** Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. **45** You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. **46** You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. **47** Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.” **48** And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” **49** Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this, who even forgives sins?” **50** And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”

The question that may arise over our present verse is, “Was Rahab’s act of hiding the spies what initially saved her?” The answer to this question is no and lies within the context itself in **Joshua 2:8-11**. Verses nine to eleven read, “*I know that the* *Lord* *has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you*. **10** *We have heard how the* *Lord* *dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed*. **11** *When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone’s courage failed because of you, **for the*** **Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below**.” Rahab’s acknowledgment in this last bolded sentence was not a mere intellectual assent to facts but stemmed from complete faith and trust that she had put in Israel’s God, and she proved this by hiding the spies and lying to the officials to save them. Would an unbelieving citizen of Jericho have done the same? Most likely not because they would have wished to defend the city like the rest of their unbelieving comrades. 

Yes, the rest of Jericho’s citizens were also, like the Demons mentioned in **James 2:19**, living in fear of Israel’s God but not in reverant awe and obedience demonstrated by that of a believer (**Philippians 2:12**). Rahab not only intellectually accepted Christ but had fully committed herself to Him in complete faith and trust, demonstrated by this inspiring act of obedience. 

With all that said, is this the same Rahab recorded in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in **Matthew 1:5**? It is my view that they are the same person (Rahab was also the great-great-grandmother of King David). Many scholars have dismissed this idea because, much like how Simon the Pharisee disqualified (in his own mind) the female sinner in his midst, some are unwilling to accept that a person with such a bad track record (a prostitute) could be within Christ’s lineage. However, this kind of prejudice (based on something irrelevant only because it rubs some people the wrong way) often (though not always) comes through how people feel about the subject instead of just accepting that they are the same person (the Bible nowhere mentions any other Rahab by name or elsewhere hints at there being two different individuals in James, Hebrews, or Matthew). Time and space do not permit a more thorough examination of that subject (nor is it the point of our verse). Still, I would encourage the reader to visit the following link by Pastor Steven Tammen for more information. 

https://www.bibledocs.org/questions-and-answers/reader-correspondence/on-the-possibility-of-multiple-rahabs/   

Another relatively common dispute over this and the other verses mentioning Rahab is whether she truly told a lie and whether it is ever justifiable to do so. Some have gone so far as to say that Rahab never lied because, once again, how could someone so well-spoken of by Scripture have done such a thing? After all, lying is ALWAYS sinful, right? There are times when lying is not sinful, and Rahab is a prime example of that. But some desperately wish to try to get around this clear fact by concocting a view that she didn’t lie. This would be what I would consider engaging in bad (not to mention legalistic) theology that attempts to redefine words and sentences and then impose them on Scripture. Simply put, we don’t need to worry about views to the contrary and may well take **Joshua 2** at face value. Rahab did lie, but it was not sinful in any way. 

True, **James 2:25** doesn’t mention the part about Rahab lying. However, that is because it didn’t need to, as the lie was intertwined with the process. What point would there have been in concealing the spies from the officials if she was only going to reveal them later? That would have defeated the whole point and purpose of her hiding them in the first place! Rahab lied for the spies for the same reason she hid them. Therefore, we may commend her for doing so. 

Despite all this, our verse does not encourage us to lie when it would be sinful to do so (which would probably be about 99.9% of the time). Lying is almost always a sin, except in rare instances (such as those found in Scripture and in some historical cases throughout history). When it comes to our brothers and sisters in Christ, we would hope we would never give away their location or identity to the officials (assuming we ever found ourselves in such hypothetical circumstances) if doing so meant their capture, imprisonment, and, possibly, torture and death. We should lie like Rahab if doing so protects our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ or innocent people in general when the government or others in power are acting unlawfully, not to mention unbiblically, toward innocent human beings. It would be a sin and a potential sign of apostasy to betray one’s family members in Christ for the sake of evading potential pressure and persecution. Sadly, this will occur in mass numbers during the Great Tribulation to come, when many believers will fall away from the faith to follow and serve the Antichrist.

**24** Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. **25** For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. **26** What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? **27** For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.

It is also worth mentioning the fact that we should NEVER deny our faith to save the physical life of another person. Nor should we ever lie about rejecting our faith for the sake of someone else’s life. So, although this is a hypothetical that we don’t need to worry about as long as we understand the principle teaching (that being we should never deny our faith under any circumstances, whether under pretenses or not), to deny Christ for the sake of another believer’s physical life would be to betray both God and the brother or sister in question. If torture and death come the way of both, then it is God’s will for His glory that such should take place. And we may be rest assured that great rewards included with eternal life will come to those who stay faithful to the very end!

And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation, **8** and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain. **9** If anyone has an ear, let him hear:**10 If anyone is to be taken captive,** **to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints**.

Thankfully, there are, of course, no hypotheticals, and the Lord would never put us in a situation too great for our level of faith to handle (whether we end up in the type of situation described above or not). The point is that there are times to lie and take drastic measures to preserve the life of another brother or sister, while there are times when we should clearly not do so.  

## Verse 26  

{{% scripture p="James 2:26 (ESV)" %}}  

**26** For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead 

{{% /scripture %}}     

### The body without the spirit is dead   

We already understand the meaning of the words, “*faith apart from works is dead*,” so we don’t need to examine that any further. But what does the first half of our verse mean? Firstly, we human beings are dichotomous, consisting of both a body and a human spirit (not to be confused with the Holy Spirit that comes to indwell the believer upon salvation **John 14:26**, **Romans 8:9**). We first see this combination of body and spirit in God’s creation of Adam (women also share this makeup, including the image and likeness of God **Genesis 1:26**) when God breathed into Adam the “breath of life” (referring to the human spirit that would come to animate his physical body). 

The Hebrew words for the human Spirit that Scripture deploys are *ruach* (רוח) and *neshamah* (נשמה) and mean “wind” and “breath.” The Greek word for the human spirit in verb form is *pneuma* (πνεῦμα) and refers to both wind and breath (see link for source by Robert D. Luginbill[https://www.ichthys.com/Fallsr3.htm#3.%20The%20Human%20Spirit](https://www.ichthys.com/Fallsr3.htm#3. The Human Spirit) ). The “breath of life” God breathed into Adam was the human spirit that all humans possess, making life possible. Without the human spirit, the physical body would be dead, just as faith without works is dead. And, yes, the human spirit is eternal, so that once God has created and implanted it into a human body, it will never cease to exist, whether in the New Heaven and Earth or in the Lake of Fire (depending on what the individual chose). 

The human spirits of all our departed brothers and sisters in Christ (and all those who pass away before Christ’s second advent), as was also the case with all pre-cross believers, are temporarily housed in “interim” bodies in the third Heaven to await their final resurrection body, which they will receive at Christ’s return. At that point, their spirit will then transfer to their new bodies. The only difference between pre- and post-cross believers was that the interim bodies of those before Christ’s sacrifice dwelt in Abraham’s bosom beneath the earth (**Luke 16:19-31**) instead of the third Heaven, where all believers now are and have been since the resurrection. That is because Christ had not paid for the world’s sins and so access to the third Heaven was impossible before then because a righteous and holy God can have nothing to do with sin. This explains why, after our Lord’s death, the veil in the temple was torn in half (**Matthew 27:51**), a symbolic indicator that our Lord’s death on the cross had now opened the way for humanity to the third Heaven above (**Hebrews 4:15-16**).

The word “soul” in Scripture does not refer to some third, separate entity distinct from the physical body and the human spirit, but a combination of the two (with the heart being the interface between our body and spirit; the inner “us”). For more passages and information on the human spirit and the words “soul” and “heart,” I recommend that the reader visit the link below (beginning with “The Creation of Adam” and proceeding from there). Please understand that this information is only being shared for further learning and not for the purpose of interpreting our verse of study, **James 2:26** (it is only for additional information). The information contained in the other sources is not technically necessary to interpret and understand the verse under examination. It is always my goal to fully explain the essence of what the author of the book was trying to say in that verse. Additionally, time and space do not permit us to delve into these topics in depth (we can explore these in separate, focused studies at a later time). To delve into those subjects too deeply would be too far of a deviation from our present subject in verse twenty-six.
